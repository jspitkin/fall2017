   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS EXPRESSED
SATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND
IS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF
THIS CRIME.

   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS
PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE
JESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE
PUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL
LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL
SALVADOR.

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY
THAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO
WHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE
DETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON.

   HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT
INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME
OUT.  THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL
SALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR
THEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY
LITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED.
[END RECORDING]

   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED
SINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A
POLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY
JUSTICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.
HE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY,
AND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL
VIOLENCE.  THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS
POSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES.  WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY
VIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE.  MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED.  [WORDS
INDISTINCT] TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS.  THE
LANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH.  I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A
CALMER CLIMATE. [END RECORDING]

   HE ADDED THAT A CLIMATE OF SERENITY AND RESPECT WOULD FACILITATE THE RIGHT
CONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD GUARANTEE MECHANISMS TO RECONCILE OUR
SOCIETY.  HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE
MAKING PROGRESS IN THE REVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO REORGANIZE IT IN A
WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THE HONEST ADMINSTRATION OF JUSTICE TO DO AWAY WITH
IMPUNITY.

   CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] THE
U.S.  CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES ARE FILLED WITH SURPRISES.  THEY ARE TO
RENEW THEIR SESSIONS IN 2 WEEKS' TIME, AND IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE
WAITING TO BE DISCUSSED.

   AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] STARTED ITS 11
NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE WHICH BURIED THE ARMY'S PROPAGANDISTIC CLAIMS THAT IT HAD
FINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO
MILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  ENDING THE YEAR, THE
WORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.

   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR
ADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI
HIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE
JESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT
THE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE
ONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.
THE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL
TELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE
INDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.

   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000
PEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN
ZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION
FEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN
CRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS
MADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  

   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,
IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA
RICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE
NATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT
THE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.

   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE
IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN
$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR
ARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED
MONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.
ADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN
HE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF
AID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.
IF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE
TIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.

   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON
THE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT
FOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A
DECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE
CONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY
AROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO
DISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF
THE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE
AS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT
THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE
SALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS
BY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED
STATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A
COMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.  WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A
MISTAKE.  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND
BEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.

   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]
REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, LEADER OF THE
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE AND
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICA OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, IN
GUATEMALA ON 12 JANUARY, WE STATE:

   1. WE BLAME ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], THE REGIME OF
[PRESIDENT ALFREDO] CRISTIANI AND [ARENA LEADER ROBERTO] D'AUBUISSON, AND
ITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION.  THE LINKS BETWEEN
D'AUBUISSON'S ARENA PARTY AND THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF
MARIO SANDOVAL ARE WELL KNOWN.  BOTH OPPOSE EVERY EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO
THE REGION.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE
JESUITS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE MASTERMINDS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED, FORCES US TO
REVIEW OUR DIALOGUE OFFER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE
FASCIST REGIME WASH ITS FACE TO OBTAIN U.S. MILITARY AID AND TO PROCEED WITH
ITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION.

   3. THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE
EXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES
THAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16
NOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
LATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.S. AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE
SLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS.

   4. AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A
PURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THERE
CAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL
TRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES
ITSELF THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT A GENERAL REPRESSION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON
ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO STRUGGLE FOR ITS ABROGATION.

   5. THE 15 DECEMBER 1989 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION DEMANDING RESPECT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS MUST BE UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTED
IN OUR COUNTRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] GOVERNMENT MINISTER
CARLOS MORALES SAID TODAY THAT A "FOREIGN COMMANDO" KILLED HECTOR OQUELI,
LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST PARTY NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
(MNR), AND GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER GILDA FLORES IN GUATEMALA.

   MORALES SAID AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS
THAT THE INTENTION OF THE "TERRORIST COMMANDO" WAS CAPTURING OQUELI ALIVE TO
TAKE HIM TO EL SALVADOR BUT THAT "SOMETHING MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR PLANS."

   MORALES STRESSED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE "FOREIGN COMMANDO," THE
NATIONALITY AND ORIGIN OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPECIFY, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR
MONTHS, ADDING THAT "IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS."

   MORALES SAID THAT THE GROUP HAS KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND HAS CARRIED OUT
VARIOUS BOMB ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA.  ASKED ABOUT A STATEMENT BY SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER MARIO SOLORZANO, WHO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AND
GUATEMALAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OPERATE JOINTLY IN GUATEMALA, MORALES SAID
THAT "THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION."

   "WE CANNOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY THIS TERRORIST COMMANDO CAME FROM; HOWEVER, WE
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTER ITS ACTIVITIES IN OUR NATIONAL
TERRITORY," HE STRESSED.

   OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET THIS GROUP "DEFAME" GUATEMALA WITH ITS
ACTIVITIES.  THERE IS ALREADY A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECURITY FORCES IN
CHARGE OF LOCATING THE KILLERS OF OQUELI AND FLORES.

   ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE POLICE, THE KIDNAPPING
TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WHEN OQUELI AND FLORES WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN THIS CAPITAL.

   THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING, WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE
AIRPORT, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER CAR, WHOSE OCCUPANTS FORCED GILDA FLORES
OUT OF THE CAR WHILE OQUELI TRIED TO ESCAPE, MORALES SAID.

AN ATTACK WITH EXPLOSIVES IN FRONT OF A BUILDING WHERE U.S. DIPLOMATS
RESIDE IN THE MIRAFLORES NEIGHBORHOOD IN LIMA HAS LEFT ONE PERSON INJURED.

   THE TERRORIST ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED FROM A MOVING VEHICLE, FROM WHICH
UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS THREW THREE DYNAMITE CHARGES THAT INJURED A
PASSERBY AND DAMAGED THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE. 

   THE POLICE SOURCE INDICATED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME HAVE NOT
YET BEEN IDENTIFIED.  THE SOURCE NOTED THAT IN 1984, THE FIRST ATTACK ON
U.S. INTERESTS WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE GUEVARIST TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT, WHEN ACTIVISTS FROM THAT GROUP FIRED AT THE FRONT OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LIMA.

   A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY RESIDENCE IN THE PERUVIAN

   LA PAZ, 24 DEC 88 -- [TEXT] ACCORDING TO A CLAIM MADE BY THE MINISTER OF
INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE, JUAN CARLOS DURAN, 1988 WAS A "POSITIVE
YEAR," BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO SCORE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA AS WELL AS IN DEFENSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM EXISTING IN BOLIVIA.

   THE MINISTER REMARKED:  "I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A YEAR OF FULL
ACCOMPLISHMENT, A VERY POSITIVE AND VERY GOOD YEAR"; HE ADDED THAT THE
MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR REPRESENTED PROGRESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
IN STATE ADMINISTRATION TASKS.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT GREATER CONSOLIDATION WAS ACHIEVED IN THE ECONOMIC
AREA, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE EFFORTS INTENDED TO REINFORCE BOLIVIA'S
POLITICAL SYSTEM TO BE WELL AIMED.

   HE CLAIMED THAT A SYSTEM SUCH AS THE ONE IN FORCE IN OUR NATION HAS
ENABLED THE CITIZENS TO ENJOY "ABSOLUTE FREEDOM," SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
UNDERSCORED NOT ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT IN THE NATIONS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
AS WELL.

   HE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HAD TO RESORT TO ANY UNUSUAL
ACTION TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  HE RECALLED MARTIAL LAW HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED,
ATTESTING TO PROGRESS IN THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

   HE COMMENTED:  "BOLIVIA IS AN EXEMPLARY COUNTRY IN TERMS OF FREEDOM,"
STRESSING THE BENEFITS THIS NATION HAS EXPERIENCED BY HAVING A DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISAGREE EVEN WITH THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

   HE SAID THAT THE CITIZENS AS A WHOLE HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY FOR RIGHTS
TO BE RECOGNIZED AND OBLIGATIONS ACCEPTED.  FOR THIS REASON, HE CLAIMED,
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY IN THE
VARIOUS FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE FAR MORE VISIBLE
EFFECTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

DRUG TRAFFICKING

   WITH REGARD TO THE BATTLE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFIC, HE CITED THE WORK
PERFORMED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES TO BATTLE DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, ACCORDING
TO HIS ACCOUNT, DESTROYED HUNDRED OF COCAINE FACTORIES AND PROCESSING PITS,
IN ADDITION TO CONFISCATING DRUGS AND ARRESTING PERSONS LINKED WITH THEIR
PRODUCTION OR ILLICIT TRAFFICKING.

   HE DECLARED THAT, DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS,
BOLIVIA HAS MANAGED TO RESPOND TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND TO
FOSTER A CONSCIOUSNESS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE METHODS FOR COMBATING DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.

ROBBERY

   THE MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT THE SANTA CRUZ POLICE HAD MOBILIZED IN A
"COMBING OPERATION," TO FIND THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ROBBERY OF A CAR ON
THE TRACK OF THE EASTERN RAILROAD SYSTEM FROM WHICH 130,000 BOLIVIANOS,
INTENDED TO PAY CHRISTMAS BONUSES, WAS STOLEN.

   HE SAID THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND POLICE WERE STILL COMPLYING WITH
INSTRUCTIONS TO ERADICATE THE CRIME THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON A LARGE
SCALE DURING RECENT MONTHS IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ, AND TO BENEFIT THE
EASTERN POPULATION WITH PROTECTION.

   HE EXPLAINED THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TAKING STATEMENTS FROM
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE SEEN THE HOLDUP MEN AT CLOSE RANGE, SO AS TO
CAPTURE THEM PROMPTLY.

CHILE IN 1914, TO TURN THE MURDER CASE OF FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER
ORLANDO LETELIER OVER TO AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF JURISTS.

   THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ, WHO
ADDED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THE SITUATION IN A SERIOUS

   THE STATEMENT ADDS THAT THE TERMS USED BY THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT
SPOKESMAN LAST MONDAY IN REFERRING TO THIS MATTER REPRESENT A DISTORTED AND
PARTIAL VIEW, REFLECTING THE DESIRE TO IMPOSE A POSITION DISREGARDING
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

COURTS ARE PROCESSING A ROGATORY LETTER SUBMITTED THROUGH NORMAL DIPLOMATIC

STATED:  "I HAVE WITHSTOOD THE LOWEST SLANDER FOR 8 YEARS.  GOD ALMIGHTY
AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT REPUDIATED MURDER.

   "EVERY TIME THERE ARE ELECTIONS, WE HEAR THE SAME RUMORS THAT THERE IS
EVIDENCE ABOUT MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S CASE AND THAT IT WILL BE
PRESENTED.  THUS, A GREAT SHOW IS PRESENTED, BUT ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE
OVER NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT MARTYR OF THE CHURCH.

   "DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT, SUPPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PDC,
RESORTS TO VILE DEFAMATION, SLANDER, AND LIES AGAINST ITS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS BECAUSE IT CANNOT HIDE ITS CORRUPTION."

   THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA,
DEPUTY TO REJECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, "IN A NATIONAL
RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK," THAT IMPLICATED D'AUBUISSON "IN MSGR OSCAR
ARNULFO ROMERO'S DEATH."

   "I AM SORRY I DID NOT SEE THE BROADCAST, BUT OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON
IT.  I CAN VERY WELL IMAGINE ALL THE DESPICABLE THINGS THAT WERE
IRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR
ROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.  IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S
PROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL," D'AUBUISSON SAID.

   "THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER
ME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC
HAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS
CORRUPTION."

   D'AUBUISSON ADDED:  THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' "LIE" IS AIMED AT
DECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS.  THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE,
BECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY.

   THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS.  THE PDC CONTROLLED THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN MSGR ROMERO WAS KILLED.  THE CRUCIAL
QUESTION IS:  WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE
AT THE TIME?  WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM IT HAS THE EVIDENCE YET FAILS
TO PRESENT IT?  AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME
OF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH!  THIS ENTIRE
ATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED.

   HE ASSERTED:  I AM AWARE OF THE PDC'S INCREDIBLE PLOT TO SLANDER ME,
BUT THE PDC ONLY SAYS WHAT IS CONVENIENT.  IT IS A DIRTY GAME BUT GOD IS
MY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT
CRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS.  THE PDC CANNOT
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO "ARE
GREEN ON THE OUTSIDE [REFERENCE TO THE PDC'S PARTY COLORS] BUT RED ON THE
INSIDE."  HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING LIKE A GOOD SALVADORAN SO THE
"TURNCOATS" DO NOT BETRAY US, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, MAJOR ROBERTO

   ACCORDING TO EARLY REPORTS FROM THE BOMB SQUAD, WHICH IS SUBORDINATE TO

   THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LA PAZ IS 3 BLOCKS FROM THE PLAZA DE ARMAS AND 3

   A TEAM FROM THE BOLIVIAN BOMB SQUAD MANAGED TO LOCATE AND DEFUSE THE BOMB

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 APR 89 (TCS TELEVISION) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY UNIDENTIFIED
REPORTERS] [TEXT] [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] YOU MENTIONED THE
ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO.  WE
WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE US SOME DETAILS ON THIS.

   [CRISTIANI] AT APPROXIMATELY 0530 THIS MORNING, THREE EXPLOSIVES WERE
HURLED AT HIS RESIDENCE FROM AN EMPTY LOT.  THE EXPLOSIVES CAUSED EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE TO THE RESIDENCE.  THERE WAS RIFLE FIRE TOO, BUT THE RIFLE FIRE WAS
ONLY TO DISTRACT SECURITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.

   THE ATTACKERS ACTED LIKE ANIMALS.  MR MERINO IS STILL IN THE UNITED
STATES WITH HIS WIFE.  HE WILL BE RETURNING THIS AFTERNOON.  THEIR FOUR
CHILDREN AND THREE OF THE CHILDREN'S FRIENDS WERE AT THE RESIDENCE WHEN THE
ATTACK TOOK PLACE.  THE CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THOSE WHO CARRIED
OUT THIS ATTACK ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS.  THIS ATTACK ENDANGERED
CIVILIANS.  THANK GOODNESS ONLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN WAS WOUNDED.  ONE OF
THE GIRLS WHO WAS VISITING THE HOME WAS HIT BY SOME SHRAPNEL BUT THE WOUND
IS NOT SERIOUS.  RIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING A DOCTOR TO EXAMINE THE CHILDREN
TO SEE IF THEIR HEARING HAS BEEN DAMAGED BECAUSE TWO OF THE DEVICES
EXPLODED IN THE BEDROOM THE CHILDREN WERE IN.

   I BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER INDICATION THAT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT], FAR FROM SEEKING PEACE AND WANTING PEACE
FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WANTS TO CONTINUE ITS TERRORISM, ITS KILLINGS --
ITS IRRATIONAL KILLINGS.  I BELIEVE THAT LITTLE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SINCERE WHEN
THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.

   THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCE.  THEY STATED THEIR OPINION
ON 19 MARCH.  THE FMLN SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE FLATLY
REJECTED VIOLENCE AND THE FMLN.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF OUR
PARTY WILL BE FRIGHTENED INTO ABANDONING THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION
OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE WANT.

   I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE THE FMLN LOOK LIKE MARTYRS AND LIKE
PERSONS WHO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH:  THEY
ARE NOTHING BUT SAVAGES WHO LACK HUMAN QUALITIES AND WHO ARE
INDISCRIMINATELY KILLING AND WOUNDING CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]

ANOTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED THIS EVENING WHEN A POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE THEY WERE
ATTEMPTING TO HURL FROM A PASSING MOTORCYCLE AT A U.S. EMBASSY WAREHOUSE IN
TEGUCIGALPA EXPLODED BEFORE THEY COULD THROW IT.

   THE DEAD MAN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 39-YEAR-OLD MIGUEL RODOLFO AGUILAR
FLORES OF TEGUCIGALPA.  HIS BODY WAS BLOWN TO BITS BY THE EXPLOSION.  

   THE WOUNDED MAN HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.  HE WAS ADMITTED IN A
SEMICONSCIOUS STATE TO THE BURNS UNIT OF THE ESCUELA HOSPITAL.

   ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE BOMB WAS CHINESE-MADE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DETONATED BY HEAT FROM THE MOTORCYCLE OR FROM FRICTION CREATED AS A RESULT
OF BEING PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON THE MOTORCYCLE.

   ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE TWO MEN DROPPED THE BOMB WHEN THEY TRIED TO
THROW IT AT THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS LOCATED 1 KM NORTHWEST OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY.  POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB WAS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE U.S.
EMBASSY WAREHOUSE BY MEMBERS OF THE HONDURAN LEFT TO COMMEMMORATE WHAT
PEOPLE HERE CALL "BLACK APRIL" FOR THE UNITED STATES.

   ON 7 APRIL 1988, A MOB SET FIRE TO THE U.S. CONSULATE IN TEGUCIGALPA AND

CONDEMNED THE KILLING OF 42-YEAR-OLD JOSEF PIESCHER, A VIENNA DEVELOPMENT
WORKER IN PERU, AS A "WICKED TERRORIST ATTACK ON A MAN OF GOODWILL," WHO
HAD ALTRUISTICALLY PLACED HIMSELF IN THE SERVICE OF DEVELOPMENT AID.

   THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR IN LIMA HAS BEEN ORDERED TO URGE THE PERUVIAN
AUTHORITIES TO SPEED UP INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MURDER.  ON TUESDAY [18 APRIL] 
A PERUVIAN RADIO STATION REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION
SHINING PATH HAD KILLED PIESCHER BECAUSE THEY TOOK HIM FOR AN AGENT OF THE
U.S.  INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, CIA.  IN AN INTERVIEW FOR THE AUSTRIA PRESS

MEDICINE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE AMAZON AID ASSOCIATION, CALLED THIS ACCUSATION
"COMPLETE NONSENSE."

   IN HIS STATEMENT MOCK EXPRESSED THE EXPECTATION THAT THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES WILL DO EVERYTHING TO MEET THE AUSTRIAN INTEREST IN CLEARING UP
THE MATTER QUICKLY.  HE EXPRESSED "DEEP DISMAY AND SHOCK" ABOUT THE
ASSOCIATION AND EXPRESSED HIS SYMPATHY TO PIESCHER'S RELATIVES.

   ON WEDNESDAY MORNING UDO EHRLICH-ADAM, THE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR TO PERU,
STATED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS THE FOURTH MURDER OF A PERSON INVOLVED IN

   SAN SALVADOR, 16 MAY 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [EXCERPTS]
GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS ATTACKED THE HOME OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT RICARDO ALVARENGA VALDIVIESO TODAY AT NOON, KILLING A
NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER GUARDING THE HOUSE.

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 1330 AND WAS ALLEGEDLY PERPETRATED
BY GUERRILLA URBAN COMMANDO UNITS.  DURING THE ATTACK, NATIONAL POLICE
OFFICER FIDEL SANCHEZ SANCHEZ WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.  HE WAS TAKEN TO A
MILITARY HOSPITAL BY MEMBERS OF ALVARENGA'S SECURITY POLICE.  ALVARENGA WAS
HAVING LUNCH IN HIS HOME WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS GUARDING HIS HOME WERE
ATTACKED.

   WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT FOUR YOUTHS IN A RED PICKUP TRUCK SHOT AT
THE POLICEMEN FROM A DISTANCE OF 20 METERS.  THIS LED TO AN EXCHANGE OF
GUNFIRE, ALARMING RESIDENTS IN THE COLONIA MIRAMONTES AREA.

   ALVARENGA ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] OF
BEING DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.  HE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO THE
FACT THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING 100 HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.  ALVARENGA ADDED THAT THE INSURGENTS' ATTITUDE HAS DEFINITELY
CLOSED THE DOOR ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THIS EVACUATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALVARENGA] IT CANNOT BE.  TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, I
INSIST THAT THESE HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  IF
THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, ALL OF THEM, AND THE JUSTICE MINISTER ALLOW THESE
HANDICAPPED GUERRILLAS TO LEAVE, THEN WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THAT
TYPE OF ACTION.  WHY NOT TAKE THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN MAIMED OUT OF THE
COUNTRY?  SO MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MAIMED BY BOMBS!  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
AT LEAST ONE SALVADORAN CHILD BE TAKEN TO A LARGE HOSPITAL IN GERMANY.  

   IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES.  AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?
TELL ME, HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF HUMANITARIAN ACTS WHEN OUR SALVADORAN CHILDREN,
OUR YOUTH ARE BEING MAIMED?  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT WE WILL PREVENT GUERRILLA COERCIVE ACTIONS.  THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
CANNOT PREVENT THIS.  WHAT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATE.  WE NEED TO LEGISLATE A
BIT MORE TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE SECURITY.  IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FMLN
AND, FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS ELEMENTS IT WISHES TO DESTROY... [CHANGES
THOUGHT] LOOK, THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  THIS IS TRUE.  I DO NOT WANT IT TO
HAPPEN, BUT THEY CAN DESTROY ME.  BUT OTHERS LIKE RICARDO ALVARENGA WILL COME
FORWARD. [END RECORDING]

   THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE ON BERNAL AVENUE IN COLONIA MIRAMONTES, A FEW
MINUTES AFTER ALVARENGA ENTERED HIS HOME.  ALVARENGA SUFFERED NO INJURIES.
THE FMLN HAS NOT YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.

SPECIAL HONDURAN TROOPS ENTERED SAN ANDRES AND TIERRA AGRIA, SAN
GERARDO JURISDICTION, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, WHEN ARCE BATTALION
TROOPS WERE CARRYING OUT AN OPERATION IN THE AREA.  THEY CLASHED NEAR
EL CHENGUE HILL AND ALONG THE SHORES OF TOROLA RIVER.  DURING THIS
CLASH, WHICH LASTED 4 HOURS, ARCE BATTALION WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO
ROCKET-FIRING HELICOPTERS, A HUGHES 500, AND A A-37 PLANE.

   SALVADORAN TROOPS SUSTAINED NUMEROUS CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A WOUNDED ARCE
BATTALION OFFICER.  HONDURAN TROOPS WERE PUSHED BACK AND CORNERED IN LOS
LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA JURISDICTION, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, HONDURAS.  ARCE
BATTALION LANDED TROOPS FROM FOUR HELICOPTERS IN THAT VILLAGE.  AN HONDURAN
HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS EVACUATING CASUALTIES, WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM
INTO HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN HELICOPTER, WHICH FIRED ROCKETS AND
MACHINEGUNS.

   ARCE BATTALION, WHICH SURROUNDED HONDURAN TROOPS IN LOS LLANITOS,
CAPTURED AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF PRISONERS.  IN THIS CLASH, RESIDENTS OF
THE SAN ANDRES, [WORDS INDISTINCT] CANTONS, AND RESIDENTS OF LOS CASTANOS,
LOS LLANITOS, AND LA CEIBITA WERE ROCKETED AND MACHINEGUNNED BY SALVADORAN
AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.  

   THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT PARTIALLY DESTROYED HOMES AND ANIMALS THAT WERE
KILLED.  WE ARE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE NAMES OF THE WOUNDED AND DEAD
AMONG AREA RESIDENTS.

   WE URGE THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON THE SERIOUSNESS AND
REPERCUSSIONS OF THESE CLASHES.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY'S
POLICY OF INVOLVMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR.  

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAD WARNED THAT
HONDURAN TROOPS' COOPERATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN WAR,
FOLLOWING A U.S. DECISION, WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A CLASH BETWEEN THE TWO
ARMIES.  IT IS A SECRET TO NOBODY THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE REACHED POWER
WITH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME ONES WHO
PROMOTED THE INVASION OF HONDURAS IN 1969 AND THAT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE AT THE TIME FOR MASSACRES, RAIDS, AND ABUSES AGAINST THE
HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE SALVADORAN
ARMY.  

   WE BELIEVE HONDURANS MUST THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION, BECAUSE THIS LEVEL
OF CONFRONTATION WITH INFANTRY TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT WILL SET THE TONE OF THE
CONFLICT FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE BORDER CONFLICT OF A GOVERNMENT OF
OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED AN EXPANSIONIST POLICY TOWARD HONDURAS.  

   ONCE AGAIN, WE CALL ON THE HONDURAN PEOPLE TO STOP THEIR ARMY'S
INVOLVEMENT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S WAR [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN EL SALVADOR, ITS
MAIN ENEMY.  

   WE CALL ON THE NATIONAL AND INTERNAL PRESS, ESPECIALLY HONDURAN MEDIA, TO
VISIT LOS LLANITOS, SANTA LUCIA, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, TO CONFIRM THESE
SERIOUS INCIDENTS.  WE CALL ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THE
INJURED CIVILIANS.

   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 2 JUN 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] GENERAL COMMAND HAS AGREED TO
"CONTINUE" THE DIALOGUE WITH THE NEW SALAVADORAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS
SWORN IN YESTERDAY.  THE FMLN ALSO PROPOSES CHANNELS TO FOLLOW FOR
STARTING THE DIALOGUE.

   SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) YESTERDAY PROPOSED TO THE GUERRILLAS THAT THEY
BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT WILL END THE ARMED
CONFLICT IN THAT NATION.

   A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION "CAN LEAD TO PEACE IN EL SALVADOR," THE FMLN
ASSERTED IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED TODAY IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, AND SIGNED BY
COMMANDERS FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN,
EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS.  

   THE FMLN PROPOSES "COORDINATING A CEASE-FIRE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN
OVERALL NEGOTIATION OF THE CONFLICT," WITHOUT TRYING TO "APPLY THE SAME
MEANS USED IN THE CASE OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS."

   IN EXCHANGE, THE REBELS DEMAND "THE TRIAL OF FORMER MAJOR ROBERTO
D'AUBUISSON AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S MURDER,"
AS WELL AS "THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION" OF D'AUBUISSON FROM ANY GOVERNMENT
POSITION.  D'AUBUISSON, WHO HAS DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE SALVADORAN
ARCHBISHOP'S ASSASSINATION, FOUNDED ARENA, WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

   THE GUERRILLAS DEMAND "THE DISBANDMENT OF THE DEATH SQUADS." THEY ALSO
WANT THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE CREATION OF THE PATRIOTIC CIVIL
DEFENSE GROUPS.  THE REBELS REQUEST "THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE" OF LABOR
LEADERS, MASS MOVEMENT ACTIVISTS, AND DETAINED POLITICAL PRISONERS, AND THEY
DEMAND THAT MURDERS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF REPRESSION AGAINST
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES CEASE.

   THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT THE REBELS ARE WILLING TO AGREE TO A
CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT "WHEN IT IS AGREED UPON AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER
INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION," AS WELL AS TO A MULTILATERAL CUTBACK OF MILITARY
SUPPLIES "OF ANY KIND TO ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS AND GROUPS
INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT."

   THE FMLN COMMAND PLEDGES THAT ONCE THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, IT
WILL "REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT"
AND FROM ENFORCING NATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGES.  THE FMLN OFFERS TO
"RESPECT THE LIVES AND LIBERTY" OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS'
RELATIVES, AS WELL AS TO "SUSPEND" THE USE OF CAR BOMBS IN THE CITIES.  

   THE GUERRILLAS ALSO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING "U.S.  PERSONNEL AND
INSTALLATIONS IN EL SALVADOR" AND TO SUSPENDING ATTACKS ON THE ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM AND ON URBAN SHOPPING CENTERS.

   DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TALKS, THE GUERRILLAS POINT OUT, THE POLITICAL
PARTIES NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA)
GOVERNMENT COULD PROMOTE AND ARRANGE THE DIALOGUE UNTIL "A DIRECT
NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN" IN PLACES AND ON DATES
"MUTUALLY AGREED UPON" IS ACHIEVED.

   THE INSURGENT LEADERSHIP WARNS THAT IF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES
DOES NOT TAKE PLACE, THE INAUGURATION OF THE ARENA GOVERNMENT WILL MEAN "THE
HEIGHTENING AND PROLONGATION OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR."  

   THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE ALSO PROPOSES THAT AGRARIAN REFORM BE CONTINUED.  THE
REBELS ALSO WANT THE NATIONALIZATION OF BANKING AND OF FOREIGN TRADE,
UNRESTRICTED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, AND RESPECT FOR THE COMMITMENT MADE BY
THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION TO "EVACUATE THE WOUNDED AND MAIMED GUERRILLAS"
AND TO RESPECT THE LIVES OF RELATIVES OF THE LEADERS OF MASS MOVEMENTS,
OPPOSITION PARTIES, AND THE FMLN.

   POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES HAVE STEPPED UP SURVEILLANCE AROUND THE CANO

HUILA AND NORTH SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS.

   THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN HUILA DEPARTMENT TOOK PLACE IN LA MOTOSA, NEAR
AIPE MUNICIPALITY, WHERE THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL BETWEEN NEIVA AND
LA DORADA WAS DYNAMITED.  HUMBERTO BRINES TRAVELED EARLY TODAY TO THE SCENE
OF THE EVENTS AND REPORTED THE FOLLOWING:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BRINES] A NEW ATTACK WAS PERPETRATED LAST NIGHT AGAINST
THE PIPELINE THAT PUMPS CRUDE OIL FROM NEIVA TO DORADA.  SUSPECTED ELN
GUERRILLAS PLACED A DYNAMITE CHARGE AT THE PLACE CALLED LA MOTOSA, NEAR AIPE
MUNICIPALITY, WHICH COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE GUARD POST AND A STRETCH OF THE
PIPELINE.  A FIRE IMMEDIATELY BROKE OUT AND THE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETELY
GUTTED.

   CRUDE OIL PUMPING WAS SUSPENDED AND EFFORTS TO CONTAIN THE FIRE AND TO
REPAIR THE PIPELINE BEGAN AT 2300.  THE EXTENT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT YET
BEEN ASSESSED.  THIS PIPELINE PUMPS 58,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY.  THE MAIN

PUMPING OPERATIONS AT 1000.

   EVEN THOUGH THE ELN HAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED THE OIL PIPELINES, WORK HAS
CONTINUED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MULTIPLE PIPELINE IN HUILA, WHICH
WILL PUMP 138,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY BETWEEN NEIVA AND COVENAS.  THE

   BOGOTA, 21 JUN 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION (ELN) ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST THAT THAT IT IS WILLING TO
ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE ON THE COUNTRY'S OIL POLICY.  THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT
A DESTRUCTIVE WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO FORCE
THE GOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THIS INDUSTRY.

   THE GUERRILLA GROUP'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIALOGUE IS
CONVEYED IN A TAPE SENT TO CONSERVATIVE SENATOR ALVARO LEYVA FROM FORMER
SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ, WHO IS THE ELN'S FOUNDER AND LEADER.  ACCORDING
TO LEYVA, PEREZ EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH HIM TO EXPLAIN THE
GUERRILLA GROUP'S IDEAS ON WHAT COLOMBIA'S OIL POLICY SHOULD BE.  LEYVA SAID
THAT THE ELN ALSO DEMANDED THAT NATIONALIZATION BE APPLIED TO OTHER NATURAL
RESOURCES.

   FURTHERMORE, THE ELN -- WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S
PEACE OFFER -- REITERATED ITS DESIRE TO "HUMANIZE" THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
GUERRILLAS AND THE ARMY, SO THAT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION WILL NOT BE
AFFECTED.

   LEYVA HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN SEEKING A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN
GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE GOVERNMENT.  TO THIS END HE HAS MET SEVERAL TIMES
WITH M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] AND REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC) COMMANDERS, WHICH IS WHY THE ELN SELECTED HIM AS THE BEARER OF ITS
MESSAGE.

   THE ELN HAS CONCENTRATED ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S MAIN
OIL PIPELINE, WHICH EXTENDS 800 KM FROM THE EASTERN TO THE NORTHWESTERN
REGIONS OF COLOMBIA.  IT HAS CAUSED MILLIONS IN LOSSES TO THE STATE
COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE [ECOPETROL] AND SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE
RESULTING FROM OIL SPILLS.

   IN 1988, IT ATTACKED THE NATION'S PIPELINES APPROXIMATELY 50 TIMES, AND
THUS FAR THIS YEAR THE ELN HAS CARRIED OUT 21 ATTACKS.  ON 16 JUNE, THE MAIN
OIL RESERVES IN THE CARIBBEAN PORT CITY OF COVENAS WERE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED
BY SEVERAL DYNAMITE BLASTS SET OFF BY THE GUERRILLAS.

   THIS WAS THE ELN'S MOST DARING AND SERIOUS ATTACK TO DATE.  THE ELN
CLAIMS THAT THE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT CARRY OUT OIL EXPLORATION AND

   BOGOTA, 4 JUL 89 (RUDE PRAVO) -- [ARTICLE] [MANUEL CEPEDA, MEMBER
OF THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE POLITBURO] [TEXT]
RECENTLY NEW PHENOMENA HAVE MADE THEIR WAY ONTO THE COLOMBIAN
POLITICAL SCENE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS
HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADOPT MEASURES AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING
PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AND DIFFERENCES ARE BEGINNING TO APPEAR IN
THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THE ARMED FORCES.

   THESE ARGUMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO
THE ELECTIONS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN COLOMBIA IN 1990.  AFTER
THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY [CCP] HAD DEMANDED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECURE
GUARANTEES THAT IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEM, IT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BECOME
INVOLVED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND NOW IT IS STRIVING TO CREATE A BROAD
DEMOCRATIC COALITION.

   THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS AS WELL AS THE WIDESPREAD INTERNATIONAL
CONDEMNATION OF THE "DIRTY WAR" IN COLOMBIA FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE
MORE DECISIVE STEPS IN A NUMBER OF SPHERES.  THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE ARE:

   -- ISSUING PRESIDENTIALLY PROCLAIMED DECREES AGAINST HIRED ASSASSINS AND
CREATING AN ELITE MILITARY FORCE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM; ORGANIZING A
STRUGGLE AGAINST ULTRA RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND INCREASING PRISON
SENTENCES UP TO 20-30 YEARS FOR SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF
THEM;

   -- CONDUCTING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEFTIST COALITION PATRIOTIC UNION
(WHICH THE CCP IS A MEMBER OF) AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WITH
THE PARTICIPATION OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE;

   -- CONDUCTING A PURGE IN THE ARMY DIRECTED AGAINST THE OFFICERS WHO ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH GROUPS OF HIRED ASSASSINS.

   THE REASON FOR ACCELERATING THESE MEASURES WAS THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE SECRET POLICE (DAS), GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ,
CARRIED OUT ON 30 MAY BY PARAMILITARY GROUPS WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY DRUG
TRAFFICKERS.  A VEHICLE FILLED WITH 100 KG OF DYNAMITE WAS USED TO TRY TO
ASSASSINATE THE HEAD OF STATE SECURITY.  THE GENERAL ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY
BUT DURING THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 7 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 50
WERE WOUNDED.  BECAUSE OF THIS ACT DIFFERENCES IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IN
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER INTENSIFIED.

   MAZA MARQUEZ HAS BEEN THE SWORN ENEMY OF THE MAFIA AND THE OBJECT OF
THEIR THREATS SINCE HE REVEALED THAT THE GANGS WHICH CARRY OUT ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPTS AGAINST THE CCP AND THE PATRIOTIC UNION ARE TRAINED MERCENARIES
FROM THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE FRG, AND GREAT BRITAIN.  AFTER ESCAPING
FROM AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON 3 MAY, GENERAL MAZA MARQUEZ SENT A LETTER
TO THE STATE PROSECUTOR.  IN IT HE SAID THAT CERTAIN GROUPS IN THE ARMY KNEW
ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED AGAINST HIM.  

   DURING THE SAME PERIOD CAPTAIN WANUMEN [NAME AS PUBLISHED] WAS
IMPRISONED; HE HAD SECRET DOCUMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, THE
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA, THE DAS, AND THE
AMERICAN CIA WHICH LIST HIGHLY PLACED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO WORK
AS "SPIES" FOR THE BENEFIT OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM THE MEDELLIN AND CALI
CARTELS.  ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BARCO VARGAS DENIED THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE
DOCUMENTS, REPORTS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED THAT THE RULING ELITE HAS BEEN
INFILTRATED WITH MAFIA AGENTS.

   IN THIS SITUATION SPACE OPENS UP FOR THE CCP'S PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE
PEACE TO THE COUNTRY BY WAY OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL
PARTISAN GROUPS, NOT JUST WITH THE M-19 MOVEMENT, AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS
PRACTICED TO DATE.  ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IN COLOMBIA IS STILL SERIOUS,
THERE ARE DEFINITE SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND FOR THE BETTER.

   BOGOTA, 28 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO SAID
IN A MESSAGE "TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," WHICH WAS ISSUED THIS EVENING
BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, THAT "THE SURVIVAL OF COLOMBIA, ONE OF
THE MOST STABLE AND OLDEST DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA, IS IN DANGER."

   THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT CATEGORICALLY STATED:  "WE CANNOT REST UNTIL WE
HAVE DESTROYED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.  WE HAVE CAPTURED
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTIES AND
AIRCRAFT, AND WE WILL STEADFASTLY PURSUE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS DESPITE THEIR
RESOURCES AND MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS."

   THE PRESIDENCY SAID THAT BARCO'S MESSAGE WAS ALSO BROADCAST BY THE MOST
IMPORTANT TELEVISION NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

   DRUG TRAFFICKERS "MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES
RUNNING FROM A CIVILIZED SOCIETY," BARCO SAID IN HIS MESSAGE.

   THE PRESIDENT ADDED THAT "THERE MUST BE NO RESPITE OR HOME FOR THEM" AND
THAT "THERE MUST BE NO MARKET FOR THEIR DRUGS."

   BARCO'S DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS BROADCAST
SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT FABIO OCHOA RESTREPO, FATHER OF JORGE
LUIS, FABIO, AND DAVID OCHOA VASQUEZ -- WHOSE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN REQUESTED
BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES -- SENT A PUBLIC LETTER TO BARCO PROPOSING THAT THEY
START "WITH A CLEAN SLATE."

   BARCO ADDED THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT
JUST STRUGGLING AGAINST COLOMBIA, BECAUSE "THE WHOLE WORLD IS UNITED IN ITS
INDIGNATION AND IN ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE ACTIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY CARRYING
OUT."

   VIRGILIO BARCO SAID DRUG TRAFFICKING IS "A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT IS
BEING NURTURED BY THE HABITS OF MILLIONS OF COCAINE CONSUMERS, SOME OF WHOM
ARE PROBABLY LISTENING."

   "THOSE WHO DEPEND ON COCAINE HAVE PERMITTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOST
VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD HAS KNOWN," THE PRESIDENT
STATED.

   "WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED A MATTER OF PERSONAL HABITS HAS HAD EXPLOSIVE
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY," HE ADDED.

   BARCO WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:  "NATURALLY, IT IS MORE
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REDUCE THE DEMAND THAN FOR US TO REDUCE THE OFFER.  WE
CANNOT FULLY DESTROY DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING
EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS AND WHILE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO CONSUME
ILLEGAL DRUGS SOMEWHERE, IN SOME COUNTRY."

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS 10
DAYS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.

   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 13 SEP 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] WITH MODERATE
OPTIMISM, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS OPENED A
DIALOGUE IN MEXICO CITY TODAY TO ESTABLISH PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WITH
A SPECTACULAR PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE INSURGENTS THAT THEY ARE
PREPARED TO DECLARE A DEFINITIVE CEASE-FIRE AND BECOME A POLITICAL
PARTY.

   THIS PROPOSAL -- WHICH ENTAILS A DECISION TO LAY DOWN ARMS IF
CERTAIN PRIOR CONDITIONS ARE MET -- DID NOT MEET WITH A MATCHING
PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN A
MODERN BUILDING BELONGING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN A
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF MEXICO CITY.

   COMMANDER MIGUEL SAENZ OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT (FMLN) SAID DURING A RECESS THAT "THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMISSION
DID NOT BRING ANY SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL."

   ALL THE MEN WERE WEARING COATS AND TIE, WHEREAS THE FEMALE FMLN
COMMANDERS WERE IN VERY FORMAL ATTIRE.

   THE MEETING IS TAKING PLACE IN A 10-SQUARE-METER ROOM IN WHICH THE
GOVERNMENT DELEGATES AND GUERRILLAS SIT FACE-TO-FACE, WITH THE
MODERATORS AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.  THE ROOM HAS AN ANNEX TO WHICH
THE NEGOTIATORS WITHDRAW DURING RECESSES TO ANALYZE THE OTHER SIDE'S
POSITIONS.

   MSGR ROMEO TOBAR ASTORGA, WHO IS THE MODERATOR OF THE MEETING AND
PRESIDENT OF THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, HAD ASSERTED BEFORE
THE START OF THE MEETING THAT HE COULD SEE A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH SIDES
"TO END A WAR THAT HAS CAUSED MANY VICTIMS."

   "ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A MARXIST, BECAUSE THAT IDEOLOGY IS ATHEISTIC
AND MATERIALISTIC, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS URGENT THAT THIS DIALOGUE
LEAD TO THE PEACE WE LONG FOR," HE ALSO SAID.

   SAENZ, WHO ALSO SOUNDED OPTIMISTIC BUT CAUTIOUS, SAID DURING A
BRIEF TALK WITH NEWSMEN THAT PROCEDURES FOR THIS AND SUBSEQUENT
MEETINGS ARE UNDER DISCUSSION, AND TIMETABLES, STAGES, AND SITES
SHOULD RESULT FROM THEM.

   SHORTLY BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, OSCAR SANTAMARIA, WHO IS THE
JUSTICE MINISTER AND ONE OF THE OFFICIAL DELEGATES, ASSERTED THAT
"THERE IS UTMOST WILLINGNESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE" ON THE PART OF THE
GOVERNMENT.

   IN ADDITION TO SANTAMARIA, THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION ARE PRESIDENCY MINISTER JUAN MARTINEZ, POET DAVID ESCOBAR,
AND ADVISERS HECTOR CONTRERAS AND ABELARDO TORRES.  TOBAR ASTORGA IS
ACCOMPANIED BY MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN
SALVADOR.

   BESIDES SAENZ, THE FMLN IS REPRESENTED BY COMMANDERS SHAFIK HANDAL,
SALVADOR SAMAYOA, ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ, MERCEDES LETONA, MARIO
ROJAS, AND DANIEL LOPEZ.

   AT 1045 (1645 GMT), 1 HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN, THE FMLN
RELEASED ITS PROPOSAL TO THE PRESS, WHICH INCLUDES A CEASE-FIRE ON 15
NOVEMBER, A DEFINITIVE END TO THE HOSTILITIES ON 31 JANUARY, AND THE
INCORPORATION OF ITS LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS INTO THE COUNTRY'S
POLITICAL LIFE THROUGH A POLITICAL PARTY.

   THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED BY THE FMLN INCLUDE REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEMS, AN END TO ALL MANNER OF REPRESSION, THE PURGING
 AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, THE FULL EXERCISE OF
FREEDOMS (VERIFIED BY THE UN AND THE OAS), THE REORGANIZATION OF THE
ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE HOLDING OF THE 1991 LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE
ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.

   THE FIRST STEP THE FMLN WOULD TAKE ONCE THE CEASE-FIRE IS IN PLACE
WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE THE STATUS OF ITS MILITANTS AND ITS MEDIA. "THIS
STEP INVOLVES RISKS, BUT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THEM," THE GUERRILLA
DELEGATES SAID.

   THE TALKS WERE CONTINUING EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT ACCESS TO
THE PRESS AND AMID A DISCREET SECURITY MEASURE ESTABLISHED BY THE
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT -- JUST A COUPLE OF MEN WITH "WALKIE-TALKIES" AND
DISGUISED WEAPONS.

   SAVE FOR AN UNFORESEEN OBSTACLE, THE MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO
CONTINUE TOMORROW, THURSDAY.

HAZVUMB ON THE DAY GALAN WAS KILLED.  THE LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM THAT
GALAN SARMIENTO WAS KILLED BY AN UZI SUBMACHINEGUN AND THAT THE ONE
FOUND AT THE APARTMENT WHERE THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED WAS AN
INGRAM.  BALLISTIC TEST RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REVEALED.  THE
DEFENSE LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED THE COURT DECISION, AND NOW THE COURT
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE

   BOGOTA, 26 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [TEXT] THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP [19
APRIL MOVEMENT], WHICH IS ABOUT TO SIGN A PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE
GOVERNMENT, TODAY PROPOSED OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.  ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, ONE OF THE DRUG
LORDS IS SURROUNDED.

   MEANWHILE, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL IN THE CARTAGENA DE
INDIAS TOURIST CENTER, ON THE CARIBBEAN, KILLING TWO PERSONS.  IT IS
BELIEVED THE BOMB WAS PLACED BY GROUPS LINKED TO NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS.

   THE M-19 PROPOSED PARDONING THOSE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WHO
DISMANTLE THEIR BUSINESSES AND BECOME LAW-ABIDING.

   IN RADIO STATEMENTS MADE TODAY, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO
LEONGOMEZ SAID THAT THE GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION HAS MADE CONTACT WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, WHO HAVE REPORTEDLY SAID THEY ARE WILLING
TO JOIN A GENERAL PEACE PLAN.

   THE PROPOSAL WAS SIGNED BY THE HIERARCHY OF THE M-19 -- FOUNDED IN
1974 AND ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS -- IN
THEIR CAMP IN SANTO DOMINGO, SOME 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA.

   IN EXCHANGE FOR DISMANTLING THE LABORATORIES AND THE ARMED GROUPS,
THE M-19 PROPOSED NOT EXTRADITING THE ALLEGED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS TO
THE UNITED STATES.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL HAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO
BARCO, INASMUCH AS IT HAD VOICED ITS DETERMINATION NOT TO HOLD ANY
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, A JUDICIAL SOURCE HAS TOLD
REUTER.

   "THE ISSUE OF THE DIALOGUE IS BECOMING VERY SERIOUS AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY A WAR ALWAYS
CONCLUDES WITH A PEACE AGREEMENT," ONE OF THE ADVISERS OF FORMER
JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF SAID.

   THE M-19 PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES A PLAN SO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS THEMSELVES WILL FINANCE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUG
CONSUMPTION, HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED YET BY THE GOVERNMENT.

   IN AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE ISSUE OF THE
DIALOGUE WITH THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS WILL NOT FORM PART OF THE
PEACE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE M-19.

   RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS AND THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS HAVE HAD THEIR UPS AND DOWNS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

   AT FIRST, SOME ARMED GROUPS GAVE PROTECTION TO THE NARCOTICS
TRAFFICKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY FOR PURCHASING WEAPONS.  HOWEVER,
LATER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE BUSINESS, THEY WERE
HARSHLY FOUGHT BY THE PARAMILITARY BANDS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT FINANCED
WITH DRUG MONEY.

   PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE TOPIC WILL NOT AFFECT THE SIGNING OF
THE AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED SINCE 24 SEPTEMBER FOR
"LAST-MINUTE MINOR DIFFICULTIES."

   HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS
OVER 600 MILITANTS, WILL NOT BE TURNED OVER TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, PROBABLY THE RED CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 -- WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PEACE PLAN SHOULD
BE DEMOBILIZED AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IS ASKING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH
THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALSO KNOWN AS "EL MEXICANO," IS SURROUNDED
AND WILL BE IMMINENTLY CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) HAS
TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE CAPTURING IMPORTANT PEOPLE WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW IF RODRIGUEZ GACHA WILL
ALSO BE CAPTURED."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED THE CAPOS OF THE
FEARFUL MEDELLIN CARTEL, A NARCOTICS ORGANIZATION WHICH TOGETHER WITH
ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI IS CHARGED WITH EXPORTING 80 PERCENT OF
THE COCAINE CONSUMED IN THE UNITED STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A 100-MILLION-PESOS REWARD
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF
THE TWO MOST-WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   ON 25 SEPTEMBER, A JUDGE ORDERED THE ARRESTED OF FREDDY RODRIGUEZ
CELADES, SON OF "EL MEXICANO," FOR ILLEGAL PSSESSION OF FIREARMS.

   NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED THAT THE TWO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS ARE IN COLOMBIAN
TERRITORY, THUS DENYING RUMORS TO THE EFFECT THEY WERE SETTING UP
BASES IN PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   BOGOTA, 24 SEP 89 (EL TIEMPO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] WHAT
IS THE TRUTH OVER THE SIGNING OF THE DECREES?  WERE THEY SIGNED ONLY
AFTER THE ATTACK ON LUIS CARLOS GALAN?

   [DE GREIFF] THE DECREES WERE BEING STUDIED SINCE NOON ON THE DAY OF
HIS DEATH.  IT HAD BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK.  THE MAGISTRATE AND THE
COLONEL HAD BEEN MURDERED; GALAN WAS MURDERED THAT EVENING.  THERE WAS
MUCH DISCUSSION OVER THE DRAFTS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ATTACK ON
GALAN HURRIED THINGS UP.

   IN THE CASE OF THE EXTRADITION DECREE, WE WERE ALL AWARE THAT IT
WAS NOT A POPULAR MEASURE.  PHILOSOPHICALLY, MOST MINISTERS DID NOT
LIKE THE IDEA OF COLOMBIANS BEING TRIED ABROAD.  THERE WAS MUCH LEGAL
DISCUSSION, NOT ONLY TO DO WITH THIS CASE, BUT ALSO OVER THE NEW
MEASURES CONCERNING RAIDS, SEIZURES, AND ARRESTS.

   HOWEVER, FINALLY THERE WAS A GREAT DETERMINATION TO GIVE THE
COUNTRY ANSWERS.

   [REPORTER] THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT PROBLEMS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE
EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [DE GREIFF] WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THESE MEASURES ARE NOT AGAINST
A GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT AGAINST VIOLENCE.  EXTRADITION HAS BEEN A VERY
TOUGH MEASURE FOR EVERYONE.  THE INCONVENIENCES AND THE LEGALITY OF
THIS DECREE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE REACTIONS AGAINST IT, WERE
DISCUSSED A GREAT DEAL.  IT CAN BE THAT PART OF THE VIOLENCE GENERATED
HAS BEEN DUE TO THE EXTRADITION DECREE.

   [REPORTER] IS IT POSSIBLE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AS A WAY OF ENDING THE COUNTRY'S VIOLENCE?

   [DE GREIFF] THE GOVERNMENT SAID NO TO THE DIALOGUE, BUT WE MUST
WAIT AND SEE HOW EVENTS DEVELOP.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A GOVERNMENT'S
DECISION CAN BE STRICT, BECAUSE SITUATIONS DO CHANGE.  THE PRESIDENT
HAS SAID THAT DIALOGUE IS IMPOSSIBLE.  YOU NEVER KNOW, THINGS MAY
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

   ANYWAY, IN COLOMBIA PRACTICALLY NO WARS HAVE ENDED, BECAUSE IN
NEARLY ALL WARS AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED.

   [REPORTER] BUT IF COLOMBIA HOLDS A DIALOGUE, THE WORLD'S DOORS WILL
PROBABLY CLOSE ON COLOMBIA.

   [DE GREIFF] LOOK, IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
EXTRADITION AND I SAID IT WAS NOT POPULAR, THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO
SOLVE THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM.  IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S
STANCE, BUT IF IT IS DECIDED TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEN THIS WOULD BE A
SOVEREIGN COLOMBIAN DECISION.  OBVIOUSLY, IF THE POSITION CHANGES A
BAD IMPRESSION WILL BE GIVEN.

   THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT LOST ITS
SOVEREIGNTY.

   [REPORTER] THE INTERNATINAL PRESS FEELS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH
YOUR RESIGNATION.  ONE MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU BECAME A SYMBOL FOR
THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHEN YOU TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON.

   [DE GREIFF] I HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE ON 22 SEPTEMBER AND I TOLD
THEM THAT MY RESIGNATION WAS NOT MONICA DE GREIFF'S POSITION, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT'S.  I TOLD THEM I WAS STAYING IN THE COUNTRY, AND I
EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THE MINISTERS HERE REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS UNTIL
THE PRESIDENT DECIDES OTHERWISE.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT WILL MONICA DE GREIFF DO?

   [DE GREIFF] I AM GOING TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN RETURN.  I
AM GOING TO HELP ERNESTO SAMPER'S CAMPAIGN.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT
WORKING FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

   [REPORTER] WHAT POST HAS GIVEN YOU THE GREATEST SATISFACTION?

   [DE GREIFF] WHEN I WAS AT THE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY. IT WAS
FASCINATING.  I HAD TWO VERY GOOD BOSSES: GUILLERMO PERRY AND OSCAR
MEJIA.  I WORKED IN DELIGHTFUL HARMONY WITH A GROUP OF GOOD PEOPLE.  I
BELIEVE THAT MINING AND HYDROCARBONS IS THE SECTOR THAT HAS ENJOYED
THE GREATEST PROGRESS UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT.

   [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR FINAL FEELING UPON LEAVING THE MINISTRY?

   [DE GREIFF] EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.  I HAVE BEEN SPARED
FROM MANY BORING THINGS.  I HAVE NOT HAD TO SIGN EXTRADITION ORDERS OR
THINGS LIKE THAT.  WITHOUT REALIZING IT, I HAVE BEEN SPARED OF TIRING
THINGS.

REASONS THE GUERRILLAS COULD HAVE HAD FOR MURDERING THE PRELATE.

   THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A CHURCH OFFICIAL OF SUCH HIGH RANKING
HAS BEEN MURDERED IN COLOMBIA.

   THE ELN, THE MOST ACTIVE AND VIOLENT GUERRILLA GROUP IN THE
COUNTRY, HAS REPEATEDLY REJECTED THE OFFERS OF PEACE FROM THE LIBERAL
ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO. THE ELN--WHICH IS LED BY
MANUEL PEREZ, A SPANISH CITIZEN AND FORMER PRIEST--HAS MADE THE

AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WITH ITS LEADER, CARLOS PIZARO LEONGOMEZ,
PROCLAIMED AS A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL.

   THE M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP, FOUNDED IN THE EARLY 1970'S AND
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST ACTIVE, BECAME RENOWNED WHEN IT
OCCUPIED THE DOMINICAN EMBASSY IN BOGOTA AND HELD SEVERAL AMBASSADORS
HOSTAGE AND WHEN IT LATER OCCUPIED THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, WHERE
SEVERAL MAGISTRATES AND SUBVERSIVES WERE KILLED.

SECRETARY, HAS STATED THAT THE BRYANT TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES
WILL BE APPLIED IN THE LETELIER CASE ONLY TO COMPENSATE THE RELATIVES
OF THE FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER MURDERED IN WASHINGTON AND THE
RELATIVES OF HIS U.S. SECRETARY, RONNIE MOFFIT.  THE CHILEAN FOREIGN
UNDER SECRETARY MADE THIS STATEMENT IN REPLY TO U.S. NEWSPAPER REPORTS
STATING THAT THE TREATY WOULD BE PARTIALLY RESPECTED.

   FOLLOWING ARE VARGAS CARRENO'S STATEMENTS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HE
HELD IN BUENOS AIRES BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS OFFICIAL VISIT TO
ARGENTINA:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [VARGAS] THIS TREATY [WORDS INDISTINCT] USED BY THE
UNITED STATES IN 1989, DURING THE PAST ADMINISTRATION, TO SOLVE TWO
PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE LETELIER CASE: THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION
AND THE PROBLEM OF THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
DEATH OF ORLANDO LETELIER AND HIS [WORDS INDISTINCT] ASSISTANT.

   IT HAS BEEN AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO USE THE TREATY EXCLUSIVELY TO
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION; THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHEN WE REFER
TO ITS PARTIAL USE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] SO AS FOR THE COMPENSATION
SUBJECT, IT WILL BE USED.  WE ARE USING THE MECHANISM CREATED BY THE
FIVE-MEMBER COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS
TREATY WAS PERTINENT FOR THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY BUT IS NO
LONGER IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES.  [END
RECORDING]

   DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ARGENTINE AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS,
VARGAS CARRENO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM WILL VISIT
CHILE IN AUGUST IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION FROM CHILEAN PRESIDENT
PATRICIO AYLWIN, WHO WILL ALSO VISIT ARGENTINA AT AN AS YET
UNDETERMINED DATE.

   VARGAS CARRENO NOTED HIS SATISFACTION WITH HIS MEETINGS IN BUENOS
AIRES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND RAUL CARIGNANO, UNDER
SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS.  VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT AS A
RESULT OF THIS INITIAL CONTACT THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED
BY THE CHILEAN-ARGENTINE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, WHICH WAS SIGNED
IN 1984, WILL MEET NEXT JULY.  HE SAID THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL
CONTINUE TO HOLD FORMAL AND INFORMAL TALKS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF
COMMON INTEREST, SPEED UP THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND INCREASE MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.

   REGARDING THE SITUATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILEAN
CITIZENS LIVING IN ARGENTINA -- A TOTAL HE ESTIMATED AT 800,000 --
VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT PRESIDENT AYLWIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED
AN OFFICE TO HELP THOSE CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO
RETURN TO CHILE, ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN ARGENTINA'S PATAGONIA
REGION WHO ARE BEING TREATED INHUMANELY, ESPECIALLY BY BUSINESSMEN IN
THE BORDER AREA, AS REPORTED BY AN ARGENTINE JOURNALIST.

   CLANDESTINE, 23 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]
[CONTINUED] THE OFFICERS AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ARMY MUST THINK THIS
OVER.  THEY CANNOT CONTINUE CLOSING THEIR EYES TO THE BOMBINGS, TO THE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN
SALVADOR, TO THE MOTHERS WHO APPEAR CRYING ON TELEVISION.  IT IS GOOD
THAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING,
MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS.  THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OF
OPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYED
ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.  OFFICERS, THE BOMBS HAVE CAUSED ALL THAT SORROW
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOUSES IN ZACAMIL.

   AS WE WERE SAYING, OFFICERS, YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES: WHO ARE YOU
DYING FOR?  FOR COLONEL PONCE'S MANSIONS IN MIAMI?  FOR GENERAL
BUSTILLO'S MANSIONS?  WHY ARE THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS DYING HERE?
WHY ARE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPITAINS DYING, WHILE THE MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY ARE CONFORTABLY SITTING IN THEIR
AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES BEING GUARDED WHILE THEY ARE AT EASE, BUT NOT
REALLY AT EASE AS COMBAT IS TAKING PLACE JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THEIR
OFFICE.

   OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS, CAPTAINS, THIS IS THE APPEAL THE FMLN WANTS
MAKE TO YOU TODAY, AT A TIME WHEN THE FUTURE OF THE FATHERLAND IS AT
STAKE?  YOU MUST THINK THIS OVER, YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION, AND YOU
MUST DO THIS SOON.  HISTORY IS MOVING FAST, AND THE TIME IS RIPE. SO
WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT
WHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU.  IF YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING.  IF WE ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION HERE,
WHY IS THIS CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED BY THOSE RAMBOS SENT BY
PRESIDENT BUSH TO EL SALVADOR?  YOU ALL KNOW THIS LITTLE GROUP OF
RAMBOS IS GOOD FOR NOTHING, AS THEY ARE COWARDS.  THEY DID NOT WANT TO
LEAVE THE SHERATON HOTEL, BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS WERE THERE.  THEY ARE
COWARDS, JUST LIKE THEIR SYSTEM.  THEY ARE TINHORN RAMBOS, WHO ARE
ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD.

   AS WE SAID YESTERDAY, IF THOSE MEN WHO LEFT THE SHERATON LIKE
COMMON CRIMINALS COVERING THEIR FACES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ARE
THE ONES WHO ARE TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES, WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER
WHY THE FMLN IS DEFEATING THE TACTICS TAUGHT BY THEM.  THEY ARE NO
GOOD, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR PEOPLE, THEY UNDERESTIMATE
OUR PEOPLE.  OFFICERS, YOU KNOW THOSE U.S.  ADVISERS UNDERESTIMATE
YOU, THEY LOOK DOWN ON YOU, AS LITTLE INDIANS, AS DONKEYS.  YOU KNOW
HOW THEY THINK OF YOU.  YOU KOW THEY MOCK THE SALVADORAN OFFICERS.
OFFICERS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE U.S.  ADVISERS TREAT OUR
SOLDIERS.  THEY ARE HAUGHTY, ARROGANT, AND COWARDS.  YOU SAW THEM AT
THE SHERATON HOTEL, PISSING IN THEIR PANTS, THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE
THE HOTEL.  A COMMISSION WENT THERE, THE RED CROSS WENT THERE, BUT
THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVES
DURING THE TRUCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE COWARDS.

   WE WANT THE CIN [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER], THAT FASCIST
NETWORK THAT IS SILENCING OUR PEOPLE, TO PRESENT THE FILMS OF THE
ADVISORS LEAVING THE HOTEL.  WE CHALLENGE THE NETWORK TO PRESENT THOSE
FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE SHERATON, WITH THEIR FACES COVERED
AS IF THEY WERE CAR THIEVES.  THAT IS THE WAY THE U.S.  ADVISERS --
THE RAMBOS, THE SUPERMEN -- LEFT THE SHERATON.  THESE RAMBOS ARE NOT
GOING TO SAVE ANYONE, AS THEY CANNOT EVEN SAVE THEMSELVES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 15 MAR 89 (AFP) -- [REPORT] [ARTURO GUDINO]
[EXCERPTS] SEVERAL HUNDRED ACTIVISTS OF THE RADICAL BREAD, LAND, WORK,
AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT (MPTTL) MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN
SALVADOR ON TUESDAY, OPENLY DEFYING THE GOVERNMENT AND CONDEMNING "THE
ELECTION FARCE" OF 19 MARCH.

   PEASANTS, WHOSE HARDENED FACES AND BODIES REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF
LONG WORK DAYS, PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH ALONG WITH WOMEN, WHO IN
MANY CASES WERE CARRYING THEIR BABIES WHO NEVER KNEW THEIR FATHERS
BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED BY SECURITY
FORCES OR DEATH SQUADS, ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY TOLD AFP.

   YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES MARCHED ALONG WITH THEM SHOUTING SLOGANS
AND WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WITH RED HANDKERCHIEFS.  THEY CARRIED
IRON RODS AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN THEIR BAGS, "IN CASE THEY WERE
NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE POLICE OR IN CASE THEY HAD TO CHARGE AGAINST A
GOVERNMENT VEHICLE."

   IN THEIR STRING BAGS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE -- SOME OF WHOM CAME DOWN
FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE REACTIVATION
OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSES -- ALSO CARRIED SPRAY PAINT CANS, WHICH
THEY WERE READY TO USE TO PAINT SLOGANS ON WALLS AND VEHICLES AT THE
SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY.

   "WHAT IS OUR BATTLE CRY?  BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM," THEY
SHOUTED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE MAIN AVENUES OF THE CAPITAL CARRYING
HUGE RED FLAGS WITH A BLACK CIRCLE IN THE CENTER, THE MPTTL SYMBOL.

   ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES AND HIGH PARTY LEADERS, THE MPTTL
DEMONSTRATORS ARE "A MINORITY, INSTRUMENTS OF THE TERRORISTS OR SIMPLY
GUERRILLAS THAT CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TO PROMOTE CHAOS."

   LEFTIST LEADERS, HOWEVER, SAID THE MARCH HELD TODAY WAS THE
"EXPRESSION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE 5 MILLION SALVADORANS, A MAJORITY,
WHICH FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE THE 1932 MASSACRE, HAS BEEN SUBJUGATED BY
RIFLES AND HUNGER BUT IS NOW AWAKENING."

   BOGOTA, 8 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE CAR BOMB ATTACK ON 6 DECEMBER
WHICH DESTROYED THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT
OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE) HAD BEEN PLANNED SINCE LAST
SEPTEMBER, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DISCLOSURES.

   A POLICE SPOKESPERSON CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE BUS USED IN THE
TERRORIST ACTION WAS BOUGHT BY A MAN WHO IS A NATIVE OF MEDELLIN.  HE
USED FALSE DOCUMENTS TO BUY THE CAR FROM A SCHOOL PROPRIETOR IN
BOGOTA.

   ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE BUYER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE
SINISTER MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS INSTRUCTED BY TERRORISTS ABROAD TO
EXPLODE 500 KG OF DYNAMITE GEL IN FRONT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE
COUNTRY'S PRINCIPAL SECURITY ORGANIZATION.

   DAS DIRECTOR BRIGADIER GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ SAID ON 7
DECEMBER THAT A MEMBER OF THE SEPARATIST ETA [BASQUE FATHERLAND AND
LIBERTY] GROUP DIRECTED THE OPERATION.

   MAZA MARQUEZ ALSO SAID THAT PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA AND GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DRUG TRAFFICKERS, "ARE BEHIND
THIS CRIMINAL ATTACK."

   "THE MEDELLIN CARTEL PLANNED THE ATTACK SINCE SEPTEMBER, AFTER
ANOTHER CAR BOMB ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE MAZA MARQUEZ WAS FOILED LAST
MAY," THE POLICE SPOKESPERSON STATED.

   MEANWHILE, THREE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE ATTACK
WERE RELEASED ON 7 DECEMBER, AFTER BEING FOUND INNOCENT.  TWO OTHER
PERSONS ARE BEING HELD BY THE POLICE AND ARE UNDERGOING INTENSE
QUESTIONING.

   THE AUTHORITIES ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IS 59 AND
NOT 62, AS WAS REPORTED OFFICIALLY ON 7 DECEMBER.

   CIVIL DEFENSE AND RED CROSS CREWS, AS WELL AS ARMED FORCES UNITS,
ARE REMOVING THE RUBBLE FROM A 2-KM-PERIMETER, FEARING THAT PEOPLE MAY
BE PERSONS TRAPPED BENEATH TONS OF IRON AND CEMENT.

   BOGOTA, 24 AUG 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE PRESENCE OF BRITISH AND
ISRAELI MERCENARIES, PAID BY COLOMBIAN EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS AND
DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WAS CONFIRMED TODAY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT
OF SECURITY (DAS), COLOMBIA'S SECRET POLICE.

   THE DAS SENT A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO
BARCO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIBERAL NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO.
THE REPORT CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS A COLLABERATION BETWEEN DRUG
TRAFFICKERS AND EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, AND THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN
MERCENARIES IN COLOMBIA -- HIRED BY THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING
DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

   THE OFFICIAL ORGANIZATION ASSERTS THAT THE RECENTLY CREATED EXTREME
RIGHTIST MOVEMENT OF NATIONAL RESTORATION (MORENA) "MUST BE IDENTIFIED
AS THE CULMINATION OF A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS,
SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, GROUPS OF HIRED GUNMEN TRAINED BY FOREIGN
MERCENARIES, AND AGRARIAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ARE TIRED OF THE GUERRILLA
GROUPS' CONSTANT HARASSMENT."

   THE REPORT INDICATES THAT BRITISH AND ISRAELI MERCENARIES
IDENTIFIED AS JOHN OWEN, DAVE TOMKINS, R. PAXTON, P. GLASGOW, A.
DEWER, AND P. ATHERTON ENTERED COLOMBIA THROUGH ELDORADO INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IN JULY, BUT THE INFORMATION DOES NOT GIVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL
NATIONALITIES.

   THE DAS ADDS THAT DEAN SHELLEY, PETER MCALEESE, ALEX LENOX, AND
ANDRES GIBSON ENTERED THE COUNTRY IN PREVIOUSLY AND SETTLED IN THE
DRUG TRAFFICKERS EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS' MILITARY TRAINING CAMPS IN
PUERTO BOYACA, MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION (CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY),
LA AZULITA (SOUTHERN PUTUMAYO), PUERTO LOPEZ (META DEPARTMENT), AND EL
RECREO (CAQUETA DEPARTMENT) ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLATLANDS.

   RADIO STATIONS' REPORTS ADDED THAT COLONEL YAIR KLEIN HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED AMONG THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES BY THE SECRET SERVICES OF HIS
COUNTRY.  KLEIN WAS COMMANDER OF A PARATROOPERS' UNIT IN 1983 AND
APPARENTLY HAS A PRIVATE SECURITY AGENCY IN ISRAEL.

   ABRAHAM TZADAKA AND JACOBO BRINE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY THEIR
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.

   ON A NATIONAL NEWSCAST BROADCAST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO A VIDEO WHICH
SHOWS THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES WEARING BLUE UNIFORMS DURING WAR
MANEUVERS WITH THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING GROUPS' PRIVATE
ARMY.  THE SCENES WERE REPRODUCED BY THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IN THE
UNITED STATES.

   PREVIOUS REPORTS FROM THE DAS, REVEALED IN COLOMBIA, INDICATE THAT
THE COLOMBIANS TRAINED BY THE MERCENARIES INCLUDE PERSONS LINKED WITH
THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION AND THE
RECENTLY CREATED MORENA.

   THE FIRST PERSONS TO NOTIFY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF THE NATION,
THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY, ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES AMONG
THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING ARMED GROUPS WERE DESERTERS FROM
THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS -- IDENTIFIED AS JESUS
ALBERTO MOLINA URREA, RICAURTE DUQUE ARBOLEDA, AND VICTOR ARBOLEDA
DUQUE.

   ACCORDING TO THE DESERTERS' DECLARATIONS, THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES
CANNOT SPEAK SPANISH AND THEY FREQUENTLY MET WITH GONZALO DE JESUS
PEREZ, HENRY PEREZ, AND MARCELO PEREZ.

   ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT REVEALED TODAY, "THE PEREZES," ARE
IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA CATTLEMEN
(ACDEGAM), THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND MORENA; AND THE AUTHORITIES
CHARGE THEM WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF PEASANTS IN URABA, LOCATED IN THE
COUNTRY'S NORTHWESTERN AREA.

   LA PAZ, 18 OCT 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED
IN LA PAZ THAT A BOMB ATTACK OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING SOMEWHERE
NEAR THE PLACE WHERE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA AND PERUVIAN
PRESIDENT GARCIA ARE TO MEET TODAY.

   NAVY LIEUTENANT JUSTO MARTINEZ, COMMANDER OF THE PORT OF THE
BOLIVIAN CITY OF COPACABANA, REPORTED THAT A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE
PERUVIAN TOWN OF YUNGUYO, WHICH IS LOCATED NEAR THE BORDER BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 10 KM FROM COPACABANA.

   MARTINEZ ADDED THAT THE OFFICES OF THE DEPUTY MAYOR, A CIVILIAN
OFFICE OCCUPIED BY THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.

   THE NAVY OFFICER TOLD LA PAZ RADIO PANAMERICANA THAT RECONNAISANCE
PATROLS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER WITH PERU AND OTHER "CRITICAL"
POINTS OF COPACABANA BAY IN ORDER TO GUARD THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETING.

   IT IS IN FRONT OF THIS LAKE TITICACA BAY THAT PAZ ZAMORA AND GARCIA
WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS BILATERAL TOPICS AND MATTERS PERTAINING TO
DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   BOLIVIA AND PERU GROW 90 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S COCA LEAVES, WHICH
ARE USED TO PRODUCE COCAINE.  


TST1-MUC3-0030 (SITE)

   NO CITY (PERU), 16 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [GARCIA] AS A LATIN
AMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE
STATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED
IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR
PRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM.
THAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER
FROM ONLY ONE SIDE.  OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER
IS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE
FOR THEM.  THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY.  AS
PRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE
REGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO
MUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES.

   WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED
THESE CONCLUSIONS.  WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN
HANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS
GALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN
OFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN
EXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE.  THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE
WORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF
AIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TO COLOMBIA.  AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY
HELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN
GOVERNMENT, WERE SENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE
HELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU.

   I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT
PRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY.  IF HE HAS THAT MUCH
CONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF
WHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO
REPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN
AMERICA.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH
PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS.  THEN, AS
PRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME.  BUT THE
MEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL
INTEREST IN THE FUTURE.

   [CORRESPONDENT] WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR
FUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC?

   [GARCIA] YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM.
CARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT
DEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT.  THOSE MONOPOLIES
MIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS
GROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT
WAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL
MILITARY REGIME.  IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY
OF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES,
WHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A
MATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF
OUR SOCIAL LIFE.  I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE
PRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S.  PRESIDENT KNOW OUR
VIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM.

   [CORRESPONDENT] WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE.  THE IDEA EMERGED
IN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH
PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.

   [CORRESPONDENT] A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS
MONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT?

   [GARCIA] NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS.
FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP
ABROAD.  I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY
1990.

   [CORRESPONDENT] CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN
SAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU
FROM THE IMF.  WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION
MEAN?

   [GARCIA] WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE
EXPELLED FROM THE IMF.  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM
REGARDING THE MATTER.  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR
BANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH
BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR
FOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS.  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100
MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR
IMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS.  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO
FACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  AN IMF
CREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT
PROGRAM.  ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION
SO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT
OBLIGATIONS.  [CONTINUED]

   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 26 AUG 89 (BARRICADA) -- [ARTICLE] [MARTHA
MARINA GONZALEZ] [TEXT] TEOTECACINTE -- MORE THAN 400
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES HAVE DESERTED THE CAMPS IN YAMALES AND ARE
ROAMING THE AREAS OF TROJES, CIFUENTES, JAMASTRAN, EL PARAISO, DANLI,
SAN MARCOS, AND TEGUCIGALPA, DESPERATELY TRYING TO SLIP INTO THE
REFUGEE GROUPS TO BE REPATRIATED -- HAD TIES WITH THE CONTRAS FOR 7
YEARS AND WAS FINALLY REPATRIATED ON WEDNESDAY 23 AUGUST.

   AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE CONFIRMED TO BARRICADA THAT A CONTRA
DESERTER PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS A REFUGEE ENTERED THE COUNTRY WITH A
GROUP OF PEOPLE REPATRIATED BY THE ACNUR.

   THE TELA AGREEMENTS HAVE CAUSED HAVOC NOT ONLY IN THE CONTRA RANKS,
BUT ALSO IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS.  THEIR DESPERATION TO RETURN TO
NICARAGUA IS SUCH THAT MORE THAN 160 PERSONS TRIED TO ENTER THE
COUNTRY ON 24 AUGUST THROUGH THE MURUPUCHI AND CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER
POSTS, BUT THE HONDURAN ARMY STOPPED THEM BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE
NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.

   ACCORDING TO JOSE TOMAS OSORIO, THE REFUGEES TRUST THE GUARANTEES
OFFERED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT.  THIS WAS ASCERTAINED BY SEVERAL
JOURNALISTS AT THE CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POST.  SEVERAL PERSONS
QUICKLY GOT OUT OF A VEHICLE BUT THE HONDURAN TROOPS' PRESENCE
FRUSTRATED THEIR PLAN.

   THE RED CROSS' BRANCH IN JALAPA HAS INSTALLED A RECEPTION POST IN
CERRO LA PIEDRA, BEHIND THE TROJES CEMETERY, TO AVOID TRAGEDIES LIKE
THE ONE WHICH OCCURRED LAST WEEK, WHEN A YOUTH FELL INTO A MINED
FIELD.  THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOW BE ABLE TO CROSS THE BORDER, IF THE
HONDURAN ARMY ALLOWS THEM, WITHOUT FACING ANY DANGER.

   RED CROSS PRESIDENT DENIS GUZMAN, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE
PEACE COMMISSION, SPOKE ON 25 AUGUST WITH THE PERSON COMMANDING THE
HONDURAN BORDER POST.  HE SAID THAT THE RED CROSS WAS WILLING TO
ACCEPT ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA.  THE HONDURAN
OFFICER SAID: "WE HAVE NO INFORMATION BUT, IF MY COMMANDER AUTHORIZES
IT, WE WILL NOT OBJECT AND WILL LET THEM PASS.  HOWEVER, WE CANNOT LET
ANYONE CROSS THROUGH HERE FOR THE TIME BEING."

   SEVERAL REPATRIATED PERSONS RETURNING ON 23 AUGUST THROUGH LAS
MANOS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEMS OF THE REFUGEES AT THE CAMPS: "THERE IS
NO FREEDOM TO WORK, THE FOOD IS RATIONED, THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
HUNGRY, AND WE LIVED LIKE ANIMALS IN A CORRAL," IT WAS STATED BY
ERNESTINA UMANZOR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AT THE CIFUENTES BORDER REGION
AND LATER WAS REPATRIATED.

   REFERRING TO THE CONTRAS, THE NICARAGUANS LIVING IN HONDURAN
TERRITORY SAID THAT THE FORMER "ARE OUTSIDE THE LAW; THEY HAVE NOTHING
TO DO; THEY MUST PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS; THEY MUST BE DEMOBILIZED;
THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING TO THIRD COUNTRIES; THEY MUST RETURN TO
THEIR HOMELAND," IT WAS ASSERTED BY DOMINGO OROZCO.

   THE REPATRIATED PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED AT TEOTECACINTE WERE WELCOMED BY
LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR RETURN AND SAID THEY WOULD
SUPPORT THOSE WHO WISH TO TILL IDLE AND ABANDONED LANDS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 2 MAY 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [TEXT] WE NOW HAVE
COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ ON THE TELEPHONE.  THE ARMED FORCES,
PARTICULARLY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS ARMY BRANCHES AND GARRISONS
WHO WERE CONVENED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER, MADE A STATEMENT AGAINST
THIS OFFICER, WHO IS A DEPUTY AND THE CURRENT CEL [LEMPA RIVER
HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] PRESIDENT, AFTER HE DEMANDED
JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE WILL NOW
LISTEN TO COL OCHOA, WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN HIS STAND SINCE THE ARMED
FORCES' STATEMENT WAS RELEASED.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [REPORTER] GOOD MORNING, COLONEL.

   [OCHOA] GOOD MORNING. THANKS, RAUL.  THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TO BE
SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES.  I KNOW WELL WHAT WAS
DISCUSSED IN THE MEETING. SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF
DISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED.  THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT,
HOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AM
ENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE.  I, WHO OWE
EVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS
MONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN
THE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF
THEM, OF COURSE.  THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM.

   I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT
THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES.  I SIMPLY
DEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT
CONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A
SINGLE PERSON.  I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE
INSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH.  I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND
LOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION
TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME
NEFARIOUS MEMBERS.  I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD,
WHO FIGHT EVERY DAY.  OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE
PROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS
IF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE
INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE.  QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  MY
CRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION
AND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION.  I WOULD LIKE THEM TO
STOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION.
IT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID.
I AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR.  I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE.
COMMANDERS' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES'
SITUATION.  I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THE
STAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES.  AS THE
MILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  I NEVER MENTIONED
ANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRY
OUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER.

   [REPORTER] COL OCHOA, AFTER THE "SIXTY MINUTES" PROGRAM ON CBS IN
THE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRY
YOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS' CASE WERE
DISTORTED.  TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEEN
SAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE
RESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS' CASE.  DO YOU THINK THERE HAS
BEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION?

   [OCHOA] I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I
COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  A REDUCTION
IN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS
BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED.  I THINK IT IS
RIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT
OF MY REMARKS.  THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED
FORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF
OPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL
MISSION.  HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE
PROTECTED.

   I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF
TO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES.  WHAT HAS
ENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN
SEBASTIAN PEOPLE.  I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES.
ONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY.  THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY
WAR.  I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE
COMMANDER IN CABANAS.  I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE
POPULATION TO HELP THEM.  I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE
ARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY
MEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES.  TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT
IS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE
I LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS.  THE ARMED
FORCES CAN THUS BE SPARED GREATER DAMAGE BY THE POOR ACTIONS OF SOME
OF ITS MEMBERS.

   [REPORTER] COLONEL, IN THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS
THAT YOU ARE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE ARMY'S YOUNGER OFFICERS AND SOME
UNIONS, EVEN THE CEL UNION.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS
SITUATION?  [CONTINUED]

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE -- [INTERVIEW WITH COMMANDER JORGE MELENDEZ]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] [MELENDEZ] COL VARGAS' REACTION WAS TO BECOME
DESPERATE BECAUSE 90-MM, 60-MM, AND 81-MM MORTARS, AND 85-MM FIELD
GUNS HAVE BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY FIRED AGAINST THAT SECTOR OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 3 DAYS; ROCKETS HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM AIRPLANES.  MANY
CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND MANY HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  IN
OTHER WORDS, THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER -- PERHAPS BECAUSE
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED CLOSEST TO THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE,
AND THAT SEEMS TO WORRY THIS MAN VERY MUCH.  THIS COULD BE THE REASON
FOR SUCH AN ATTITUDE AND FOR THAT GENOCIDAL SITUATION.

   IN OTHER PLACES, CLASHES OCCURRED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY LONG ON 12
AND 13 NOVEMBER, AND DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 14 NOVEMBER IN
THE MILAGRO DE LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES.  IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES FOILED AND STOPPED THE
ARCE BATTALION, PONCE BATTALION, LEON BATTALION, AND THE MONTERROSA
FORCES [78-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] SURVEILLANCE AND
SECURITY MEASURES, AND TO HANDLE ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDING
BOMBINGS, MORTAR ATTACKS, AND STRAFINGS.  THIS MEANS THAT THE TERRAIN
MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE POPULATION.

   WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION REGARDING THE TASKS TO BE DONE
DURING TIMES OF COMBAT, BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARD THE POPULATION WHO
DECIDES TO PARTICIPATE BY DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN.  THIS INVOLVES
MANY PEOPLE.  THEY CAN JOIN NEW FORCES AND GROUPS IN CHARGE OF THE
TRENCHES, SECURITY MEASURES, COURIERS, AND ALL KINDS OF TASKS TO
SUPPORT THE WAR.

   IN SUM, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POPULATION ARE TO ORGANIZE
THEMSELVES BECAUSE, ONCE ORGANIZED, THEY CAN GIVE [4-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] AND COUNTER IT.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CALLS TO
THE POPULATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRUGGLE AND ABOVE ALL [7-SECOND
BREAK IN RECEPTION] NOT TO LET ANYONE INTIMIDATE THEM.  THEY
SHOULD NOT LET ANYONE STOP THEM FROM GOING OUT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOOD
AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED.

   GIVEN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND
FOOD, WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL TO OPEN
THE STORES WHERE THEY CAN GET FOOD, MEDICINE, AND ANY OTHER ITEMS
WHICH ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR THEIR [WORD INDISTINCT] AND SURVIVAL.
THAT IS ALL FOR NOW.  GREETINGS TO THE COMRADES WHO ARE LISTENING IN
THE CAPITAL, ALL THE COMRADE FIGHTERS, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN
GENERAL.  THEIR HIGH MORALE AND ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MAKES US
FEEL PROUD.  WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE VICTORY IS GUARANTEED.  WE ARE
PREPARED TO DO LIKEWISE AND WE SEND THEM THE COURAGEOUS, FRATERNAL,
AND REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS FROM ALL THE COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS IN

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND LEGALLY.  WE
WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE REQUISITE EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIND
AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME AGAINST THE LIFE OF AN
EXEMPLARY CITIZEN. [END RECORDING]

   PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BLAMED THE FMLN FOR MINISTER RODRIGUEZ
PORTH'S DEATH.  HE SAID THIS ATTACK IS PART OF A SERIES OF ACTIONS
AIMED AT DESTABILIZING THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE ARE VIRTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS
WAS AN FMLN EFFORT, AN FMLN INCIDENT, TO TRY AND PROVOKE A REACTION
FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.  WE FEEL THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
SHOW US WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, I
REPEAT WE ARE ALMOST SURE THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE FMLN.

   WE HAD HOPED THE FMLN WOULD REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF BARBARIC
ACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS THE DUTY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY
CORPS TO OFFER PROTECTION.  THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED: TO
OFFER GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE. [END RECORDING]

   DURING THIS EVENING'S RADIO VENCEREMOS NEWSCAST, HOWEVER, THE
REBELS NEITHER CLAIMED NOR DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.
NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE BEEN
CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN IN AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAD LEARNED, EVEN BEFORE THE
INAUGURATION, THAT THE FMLN WOULD TRY TO HINDER THE TRANSITION FROM
ONE GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER AND LATER CREATE ANARCHIC SITUATIONS FOR THE
NEW GOVERNMENT. THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT PLAN.

   I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE THE FMLN'S WAY TO FORCE US TO SIT
DOWN AND TALK.  IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE THAT AFTER RECEIVING A FORMAL
OFFER TO SIT DOWN TO TALK -- FIRST ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO BE USED AS
GUIDELINES DURING THE TALKS AND LATER TO BROACH THE MAIN ISSUES IN AN
ATTEMPT TO REACH A LASTING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THE FMLN SHOULD
STILL THINK THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY.  I THINK THEY ARE ONLY
TRYING TO DISRUPT THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S WORK. [END RECORDING]

   DURING THIS EVENING'S NEWS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID
THAT DURING TODAY'S CABINET MEETING IT WAS DECIDED TO ASK THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO DECREE 3 DAYS OF MOURNING FOR DR RODRIGUEZ
PORTH.

   BOGOTA, 25 OCT 89 (AFP) -- [TEXT] GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALIAS
"THE MEXICAN," A WELL-KNOWN COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER WHO IS ONE OF
THE DRUG LORDS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAS ADMITTED THAT HE IS IN FAVOR
OF "CEASING OFFENSIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY FORCES."

   IN A LETTER TO THE OPPOSITION'S DAILY LA PRENSA EDITED IN BOGOTA,
HE STRESSED THAT "THE MISSION EACH ONE OF US HAS AS COLOMBIAN CITIZENS
IS TRYING TO RESTORE PEACE IN COLOMBIA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, WHO ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR HAVE BECOME THE
COUNTRY'S MOST WANTED MEN, DENIED HAVING PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE
COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA
(FARC).

   ONLY 1 WEEK AGO, LA PRENSA REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA HAD
PROPOSED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FARC IN ORDER TO FACE THE WAR AGAINST
DRUG TRAFFICKING DECLARED BY LIBERAL PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO IN
MID-AUGUST.

   "THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH LETTER," SAID THE "CAPO" FOR
WHOSE HEAD -- ALONG WITH PABLO ESCOBAR -- COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE
OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS (APPROXIMATELY $250,000).

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA ALSO RECALLED HIS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FARC.

   TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION, THE DRUG TRAFFICKER REJECTED ALL
INFORMATION THAT STATING THAT HE IS THE "ACKNOWLEDGED PERPETRATOR OF
ALL CRIMES AGAINST PATRIOTIC UNION LEADERS (UP)."  HE ADDED THAT
ALTHOUGH HE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF JAIME PARDO LEAL "THE
COURT'S VERDICT WAS FAVORABLE TO ME."

   PARDO LEAL WAS THE FOUNDER AND FIRST PRESIDENT OF UP.  UP WAS
FORMED IN 1984, DURING A TRUCE SIGNED BETWEEN FARC AND THE THEN SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCUR.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, PARDO LEAL WAS MURDERED BY TWO PAID ASSASSINS WHO RECEIVED
ORDERS FROM "EL MEXICANO" ON 11 OCTOBER 1987.

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA ARGUED: "NOBODY HAS BEEN CHASED WITH SUCH
FIERCENESS IN COLOMBIA BEFORE AS I HAVE."  HE ADDED: "IT SEEMS THAT
ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE PENAL CODE HAVE BEEN THROWN AT ME AND MY
DETRACTORS ARE NOT BINDED BY ANY OF THESE NORMS."

   AFTER HE INSISTED THAT OFFENSIVES AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN ARMED
FORCES SHOULD STOP, RODRIGUEZ GACHA NOTED THAT THOSE WHO DISTURB
PUBLIC ORDER "SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP USING WEAPONS."

   "THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET COLOMBIANS TO SIT
AT A NEGOTIATING TABLE WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANYONE," HE CONCLUDED.

   VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED ALL POSSIBILITY OF
DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG MAFIAS.

   ROME (ITALY), 28 APR 89 (ANSA) -- [TEXT] THE ROME FOREIGN MINISTRY
ON FRIDAY CONFIRMED THAT TWO ITALIAN ENGINEERS AND A SPANISH
TECHNICIAN WERE KIDNAPPED THURSDAY IN COLOMBIA FROM A CONSTRUCTION
SITE SOME THIRTY KILOMETERS FROM THE CITY OF MEDELLIN.

   THE TWO ITALIANS, ROBERTO ROASCIO OF MILAN AND MARIO ACCURSO OF
ROME, TOGETHER WITH SPANIARD FRANCISCO PUJA, WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE FROM
THE WORK SITE WHERE THE MILANESE FIRM "TORNO" IS COLLABORATING IN THE
CONSTRUCTION OF A HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT BEING FINANCED BY THE WORLD
BANK.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ADDED THAT IT WAS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH
ROME'S AMBASSADOR TO BOGOTA', FILIPPO ANFUSO, AND THAT THE EMBASSY'S
STAFF WAS WORKING WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ASCERTAIN THE DYNAMICS OF
THE KIDNAPPING AND WHO MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE.

   THE FAMILIES OF THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS, IT WAS LEARNED HERE, HAVE
BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 10 JAN 90 (RADIO REBELDE NETWORK) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] DESPITE AMPLE EVIDENCE, NO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAD BLAMED THE
ARMED FORCES OF KILLING DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR
WORSENED IN 1979.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO
CRISTIANI OF THE ARREST OF 45 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS FOR KILLING 6
CLERGYMEN, A MAID, AND HER DAUGHTER, ON 16 NOVEMBER IS IN ITSELF A
SMALL AND PARTIAL MILESTONE.

   CRISTIANI, WHOSE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PARTY WAS FOUNDED
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES BY INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO PARAMILITARY
BANDS, THE ARMY, AND SECURITY CORPS, ASSERTED THAT THE NAMES OF THOSE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

   JESUIST FRANCISCO ESTRADA, WHO REPLACED FATHER JOSE IGNACIO
ELLACURIA -- ONE OF THOSE MASSACRED -- AT THE RECTORSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR, WARNED THAT IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH SARGENT PULLED THE TRIGGER BUT WHO GAVE HIM
ORDERS TO DO SO NEEDS TO BE REVEALED.  CRISTIANI WILL NOT GO THAT FAR.

   COSMETIC SACRIFICES ARE MADE IN ORDER TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT OF
U.S. CONGRESS INTERRUPTING THE $1.5 MILLION IT SENDS A DAY FOR THE WAR
AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] AND THE
REPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE.

   THE DISMISSAL OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO AS CHIEF OF THE AIR
FORCES AND THE POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT OF SOME OF THE COUNTERINSURGENT
ATLACATL BATTALION FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS.  HOWEVER, CRISTIANI
WILL ATTEND THE NEXT INFORMAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN
TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS ON 28 JANUARY UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS.

   THE MOBILIZATION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST THE
U.S. INTERVENTION IN PANAMA AND ITS AIM OF EXTENDING THE INTERVENTION
TO OTHER NATIONS OF THE AREA HAVE WEAKENED WASHINGTON'S DIPLOMATIC
SPACE. THIS COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS POLITICAL ALLY OF EL SALVADOR
WHICH, IN THE PREVIOUS SUMMIT HELD IN DECEMBER, PRESENTED NICARAGUA
AND THE FMLN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORSENING OF THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.

   THE FACTS ARE CONCLUSIVE. WHAT WILL NOW BE THE EXCUSE OF SALVADORAN
PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS PROTECTOR GEORGE BUSH?

   LA PAZ, 25 MAY 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES --
AGED 19 AND 21 -- WERE SHOT TO DEATH LAST NIGHT BY A GROUP OF
TERRORISTS FROM THE ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION [FAL].

   THIS IS THE SAME TERRORIST GROUP THAT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE FOILED
ATTACK AGAINST FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ IN AUGUST
1988.  IN OCTOBER, THE GROUP BLEW UP THE LINES PROVIDING POWER TO LA
PAZ, RESULTING IN A POWER OUTAGE THERE.  THE GROUP ALSO CLAIMED CREDIT
FOR THE JANUARY DYNAMITE BOMBING IN THE CONGRESS.

   THE MURDER TOOK PLACE AT 2220 LAST NIGHT AND, 30 MINUTES LATER, THE
TERRORISTS LEFT MESSAGES WITH LOCAL NEWSPAPERS CLAIMING TO BE THE
ASSAILANTS.

   THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS HANDRITTEN, SAID: "THE VIOLATION OF OUR
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS IS A WARNING TO
THE YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS AND
TO THEIR LACKEYS.  WE POOR HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO TAKE UP ARMS.
OUR HATRED IS IMPLACABLE, AND OUR WAR IS TO THE DEATH.  FAL, ZARATE
WILKA."

   THE U.S. CITIZENS -- TODD RAY WILSON BURDENSON AND JEFFREY BRENT
BALL -- WERE MISSIONARIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS
(HEADQUARTERED IN UTAH), WHICH, IN RECENT YEARS, HAS EXTENDED ITS
ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA BY BUILDING DOZENS OF TEMPLES.  BOTH
MISSIONARIES HAD LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GENERAL CEMETERY LOCATED
IN A DENSELY POPULATED LA PAZ DISTRICT.  THEY WERE KILLED WITH TWO
BURSTS OF MACHINEGUN FIRE.

   A MORMON CHURCH SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST "TWO
INNOCENT PEOPLE" AND CALLED ON THE POLICE TO SOLVE THE MURDER.  HE
SAID THAT LAST YEAR DYNAMITE WAS PLACED AT A TEMPLE IN THE SAME AREA
BUT THAT THE CULPRITS WERE NEVER IDENTIFIED.

   THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ORDERED AN
IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION.  DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER WALTER COSTAS
ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAFFIC AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WILL CARRY OUT
DRAGNETS IN LA PAZ.

   THE KILLING OF THE U.S. MISSIONARIES HAS COINCIDED WITH THE ARRIVAL
IN BOLIVIA OF THE FIRST CONTINGENT OF U.S. MILITARY ENGINEERS,
TECHNICIANS, AND TROOPS, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TASK OF LEVELING
PATTI-PATTI HILL TO BUILD AN AIRPORT FOR THE CITY OF POTOSI.

ALEJANDRO BONIVENTO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE
AND CURRENT MEMBER OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESIGNED HIS POST TODAY,
CLAIMING THAT HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO UNDUE PRESSURE BY THE
GOVERNMENT.

   BONIVENTO MAINTAINS THAT IN APPLYING WHAT IS TANTAMOUNT TO A STATE
OF SIEGE, THE GOVERNMENT IS ISSUING MEASURES AND WANTS THEM TO BE
DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL FOR ITS CONVENIENCE AND TO SATISFY FOREIGN
INTERESTS.

   IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT 40 JUDGES MIGHT RESIGN NEXT WEEK TO PROTEST
THE ASSASSINATION OF THEIR COLLEAGUE MARIELA ESPINOSA ARANGO.

   COLOMBIAN JUDGES TODAY BEGAN A NUMBER OF STAGGERED STOPPAGES TO
PROTEST THE ASSASSINATION OF JUDGE MARIELA ESPINOSA ARANGO THE EVENING
OF 1 NOVEMBER IN MEDELLIN.  A TOTAL OF 17,000 JUDGES PARTICIPATED IN A
2-HOUR STOPPAGE.  THERE WILL BE TWO SIMILAR ACTIONS THE MORNING AND
AFTERNOON OF 3 NOVEMBER.  MEDELLIN'S SUPERIOR COURT WILL BE IN RECESS
FOR 1 WEEK.

COLOMBIAN MAFIA GROUP LINKED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES,
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND SUSPEND
THEIR COCAINE SHIPMENTS. THE EXTRADITABLES ADMITTED TO THE
GOVERNMENT'S VICTORY AND ADMITTED THAT THEY WANT PEACE IN COLOMBIA.

   THE EXTRADITABLES ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL RELEASE ALL THE
PEOPLE THEY HAVE ABDUCTED. THEY ADDED THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY MORE
BOMBINGS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR MURDERS OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS,
LAWYERS, AND JOURNALISTS.

REPORT FROM SPAIN.  AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.  ATTENTION:
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.

   SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT
SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE
KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY
FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.

   THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER
ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE
BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY
AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.

   THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL
ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.

   LA PAZ, 20 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] A POWERFUL DYNAMITE CHARGE TODAY
EXPLODED NEAR THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN LA PAZ.  THE POLICE REPORTED
THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO ALL BUILDINGS ON THE
BLOCK.

   THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2130 (0130 GMT) ON THURSDAY [AS
RECEIVED].  IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.

   JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN
ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE
U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ.

   PARADA SAID: "THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF
CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE."

   THE "ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION," A GROUP WITH AN
INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A
COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA.

   THE NOTE, SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS OF THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP,
STATES: "IN DEFENSE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE.
DEATH TO THE INVADER. OUR HATRED IS RELENTLESS; OUR WAR IS TO DEATH."

   THE "ZARATE WILLKA" GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN AUGUST 1988 FOR
THE ATTACK AGAINST THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND THE
KILLING OF TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES.

   TODAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE SHELVES OF A BOOK STORE, THE
"PEOPLE'S PERUVIAN BANK," THE STATE BANK [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED]; THE
MARISCAL BALLIVIAN BUILDING, AND OTHER SHOPS, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED
NEAR THE U.S.  EMBASSY.

   AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A GROUP OF U.S. AGENTS CALLED OFF AN
INVESTIGATION AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SHOUTED
AT THEM, "YANKEES, OUT OF PANAMA."

   THE U.S. EMBASSY PRESS ATTACHE, BRUCE WARTON, SAID TODAY THAT "IT
IS OBVIOUSLY A DESPICABLE ACTION THAT DOES MORE HARM TO BOLIVIANS THAN
TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUFFERED NO DAMAGES."

   CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [TEXT] WE HAVE STARTED
A NEW DAY, THE SEVENTH, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] IS STILL HOLDING ITS POSITIONS.  WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A
SINGLE STEP. IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE
ENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND.  THE FMLN
MAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS.
WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT
SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL.

   THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR.  LAST NIGHT WE
REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS
COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE
PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES.  THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.

   RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN
EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  POPULAR COMMITTEES
MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE
ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY.  ALL THE GROUPS IN
EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS,
TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE,
REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.  OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST
TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP
WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY
THIS MORNING.  IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH
NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST
PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE
ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND
NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST
DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY,
TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS.  IT
IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY.  EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED
CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE
PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY.

   WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN
ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT
WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO
ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY.
WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR
-- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.  [CONTINUED]

   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [ALFREDO
VILLAREAL] [TEXT] THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
[COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE] HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THERE ARE
ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS,
AS ASSERTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST.  THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE
ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS
DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN
WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING
CHARGED.

   COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT
52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN
THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING
WITH US.

   [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE
RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE
ORGINIATED?

   [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS
THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR
COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.

   [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS
LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?

   [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH
ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE
CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY
DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]

   THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP
CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF
PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO
DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN
ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE
OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION
FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC
ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN
DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]

   THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE
CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS
MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO
CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES
MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE

RECEIVING A REPORT RIGHT NOW ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR.  THE
REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE
STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME
AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDS
THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.

   SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE
MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY
ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH
THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.

   PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE
CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE
IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS
SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR
POSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.

   WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT
SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE
MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS
THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN
ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL
CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING
THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE
WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY
FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN
SAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN
FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE
REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS
INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A
STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN
SALVADOR.

   ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON
THE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS
NEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO
NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS
IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE
ANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE
PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT
BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.
YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY
OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS
SAID.

   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS
YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR
COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN
SALVADOR.  LET'S GO TO THE TOP AND THAT'S IT.

   BOGOTA, 19 MAY 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] OUT OF THE TEN CANDIDATES RUNNING
FOR THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENCY, THE FOUR WHO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF
WINNING HAVE INSERTED IN THEIR GOVERNMENT PLATFORMS SOLUTIONS TO THE
CRISIS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF THE COUNTRY, CAUSED MAINLY
BY THE NARCOTRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND THE GUERRILLA GROUPS.

   FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, "NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS" MUST BE
FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY
STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS "BECAUSE
EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME."

   GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE
PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS
GOVERNMENT PLATFORM.

   REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS
MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO "TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION" THE MERITS OF
WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW.

   "THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN
MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH
CONDITIONS," GAVIRIA STATED.  "THUS," HE ADDED, "THE DIALOGUE WILL
PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND
WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE."

   SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT "THE
SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED" AND THAT THIS "SHOULD
INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND
THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO
PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS."

   LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO "STRENGTHEN JUSTICE" AND TO
CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN
THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO
CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

   FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS "A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN
CIVILIAN LIFE" AND THE DRAFTING OF "MECHANISMS" FOR THEIR DISBANDING,
SUCH AS THE "NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR
PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.

   LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S
ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO
ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS
SOVEREIGN PRESENCE."

   ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A "DISSIDENT" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS
THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- "THE ROOT OF
OUR ILLS" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  HE
PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES.

   GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT "AGREEMENT
ON BASIC ISSUES," INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC
PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY.

   ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE "BASIC" TO REACHING PEACE.

   NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE
EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF
ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST
FEW MONTHS.

   REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE
"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT."  THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE "A POOR
DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR," AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD
RESULTS "WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT," HE SAID.

   THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC
AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.
THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF
AN "AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR
STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.

[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] IN CONNECTION WITH
THE BOMB ATTACK ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY [UCA] AT DAYBREAK
ON 22 JULY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]
STATES THE FOLLOWING:

   1.  THIS ACT IS PART OF THE POLICY OF TERROR THAT THE NATIONALIST
REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED IN AN ATTEMPT
TO DISCOURAGE ALL TYPES OF OPPOSITION TO THE ANTIPOPULAR AND
ANTIDEMOCRATIC MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING.  WITHIN THIS
FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE: THE SIEGE ON THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, THREATS
AGAINST TEACHERS AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCREASING
REPRESSION AGAINST THE PEOPLES' MOVEMENT.

   2.  THE ATTACK IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO CAUSE UNREST AMONG THE
PARTICIPANTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE OF
SISTER TRADE UNIONS THAT BEGAN TODAY AT THE UCA.

   3.  WE, THEREFORE, HOLD ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT AND THE
ARMED FOCES HIGH COMMAND RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEW TERRORIST ATTACK.

   4.  WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THE ATTACK ON THE UCA AND CALL UPON ALL
INTERESTED PARTIES TO JOIN FORCES TO CONFRONT ARENA'S TERRORIST
POLICIES.

   SAN SALVADOR, 8 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE RECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY [UCA], FATHER MIGUEL FRANCISCO ESTRADA, HAS DESCRIBED THE
GOVERNMENT'S REPORT THAT ARMED FORCES ELEMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
KILLING OF SIX UCA PRIESTS AS MOST IMPORTANT, ALTHOUGH HE ALSO NOTED
THAT THE REPORT IS INCOMPLETE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ESTRADA] I BELIEVE IT IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE WE
DO NOT YET KNOW WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES.  WE ONLY KNOW THAT THEY
BELONG TO AN INSTITUTION, AND THIS OF COURSE IS ONLY PARTIAL
INFORMATION.

   [REPORTER] DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT, OR WAS IT A SURPRISE?

   [ESTRADA] I THINK IT WAS A SURPRISE BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH THE CRIME COMMISSION, WHICH IS THE ONE
CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS ON ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE
GOVERNMENT.  THEY PROMISED US THAT IF WE WERE TO COOPERATE BY
PROVIDING INFORMATION, THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE
THE PROBLEM AND CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS.

   AT THAT POINT I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE THE PERSONS WHO HAVE
TESTIFIED HAVE ACCUSED THE ARMED FORCES, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN A
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT OR THE ARMED FORCES MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO
CLEAN UP ITS IMAGE AND CARRY OUT INVESTIGTIONS TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE
ARMED FORCES IN PRISON.  I WAS SKEPTICAL.  I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT
HAPPEN, BUT FACTS SHOW THAT I WAS MISTAKEN. [END RECORDING]

   FATHER ESTRADA HAS ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL
PRESSURE TO HAVE THIS CASE INVESTIGATED, BUT HE OPTIMISTICALLY
BELIEVES THAT THE DECISION TO INVESTIGATE HAS BEEN ADOPTED ALSO FOR
THE SAKE OF THE PRESTIGE OF THE ARMED FORCES.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ESTRADA] I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED
FORCES ARE ACTING NOT ONLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE
THEY COULD BE DENIED MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID.  I BELIEVE THAT A CRIME
SUCH AS THE ONE BEING INVESTIGATED GOES AGAINST THE VERY ESSENCE OF
THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, NOT TO HARM
THEM. [END RECORDING]

   FATHER ESTRADA SAID HE TRUSTS IN THE MORAL STRENGTH OF PRESIDENT
CRISTIANI TO SEE THIS CASE THROUGH TO THE END.  HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER,
THAT SO FAR NOTHING NEW HAS BEEN SAID AND THAT A LISTING OF THE PEOPLE
INVOLVED AND A JUST SENTENCE WOULD BE NEWS.

   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATEMENT] [FMLN]
[TEXT] [CONTINUED] A.  WE HEREBY VOICE OUR WILLINGNESS THAT THERE BE
AN IMMEDIATE IN SITU CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND AN
OVERALL AND DEFINITIVE SIMULTANEOUS NEGOTIATION LEADING TO A NATIONAL
CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION, DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY, AND
RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF SALVADORANS.

   B.  IN ORDER TO HOLD GOOD NEGOTIATIONS, WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO
ESTABLISH IMMEDIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS,
DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS, AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS THROUGH:

      1.  LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND REPEAL OF THE LAW ON REFO
THE PENAL CODES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANTITERRORIST LAW THAT WAS RECENTLY
APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.

      2.  RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.

      3.  ALLOWED DEPARTURE OF FMLN WAR DISABLED AND MEDICAL TREATMEN
FMLN WOUNDED.

      4.  IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDERS AND OFFICER
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF, FOR
HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISIONS MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND
TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; GENERAL RAFAEL
BUSTILLOS, GENERAL RAFAEL ANTONIO VILLAMARIONA, AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ VARELA, COMMANDER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE
AIR FORCE, FOR THEIR DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BOMBINGS OF THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION; COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER,
FOR HAVING SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS;
COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WHICH IS
THE CORPS THAT CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS; AND CAPTAIN ALFONSO CHAVEZ
GARCIA, WHO WAS THE DIRECT PERPETRATOR OF THESE MURDERS.  ALL OF THESE
DISMISSALS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CREDIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DECISION TO ESTABLISH GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND
AS A FIRST STEP IN THE PURGE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH IS
NECESSARY FOR THE DISMANTLING OF THE BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF
THE PAST 60 YEARS.

      5.  THE IN SITU VERIFICATION OF THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND
THE UN WORK TEAM ON THE FORCED DISAPPEARANCES.

   C.  WE THINK IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO REORGANIZE THE NEGOTIATING
TABLE TO ENSURE THAT OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS
ARE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN.
THIS WILL ASSURE A NATIONAL CONSENSUS SOLUTION.

   MESSRS PRESIDENTS: THE SCOPE OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY DEMANDS
REALISTIC VIEWPOINTS, VIABLE AND URGENT SOLUTIONS.  YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE
SO THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER WAR AND THE CENTRAL
AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS WILL YIELD SPECIFIC RESULTS.

   WE REITERATE OUR APPRECIATION TO YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS,

   THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, EL SALVADOR, 8 DECEMBER 1989.

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 AUG 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] FIRE DEPARTMENT
SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT GUATEMALAN ARMY TROOPS KILLED NINE
PEASANTS BY MISTAKE ON 17 AUGUST.  THE SOLDIERS MISTOOK THE PEASANTS,
WHO WERE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE PATROL (PAC) MEMBERS, WITH A REBEL COLUMN.

   ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT
THE INCIDENT, WHERE THREE PEASANTS WERE ALSO WOUNDED, HAD BEEN A
"TRAGIC MISTAKE."

   THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN NORTHEASTERN COBAN BASE TROOPS MISTOOK
THE CIVILIAN PATROL FOR A REBEL COLUMN AND ATTACKED IT.  THE ATTACK
RESULTED IN 9 INDIAN PEASANTS KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED, INCLUDING A
17-YEAR-OLD.

   ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT,
THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN A PAC PATROL WAS COMBING THE AREA FOR A
REBEL COLUMN THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN "LA PROVIDENCIA" FARMING COMMUNITY
AREA.

   THE CIVILIAN PATROL WAS RETURNING TO ITS COMMUNITY ON 17 AUGUST,
WHEN THE ARMY TROOPS, WHO WERE ALSO SEARCHING FOR THE REBEL COLUMN,
FIRED AT THEM BELIEVING THEY WERE PART OF A REBEL GROUP.

   THE CIVILIAN PATROL UNIT, APPROXIMATELY 70 PERSONS, DID NOT FIRE
BACK AT THE SOLDIERS.  ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY ONE OF THE
SURVIVORS, THE CIVILIANS SHOUTED AND MADE SIGNS TO THE TROOPS UNTIL,
FINALLY, THE SOLDIERS REALIZED THEIR ERROR.  THE SOLDIERS, HOWEVER,
REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE ONLY AFTER NINE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED.

   GUATEMALAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO WAS
QUERIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY "REGRETTABLE
CONFUSION" AND THAT AN ARMY COMMAND STAFF COMMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN
SENT TO INVESTIGATE IT.

   GRAMAJO SAID THE COMMISSION IS TO ESTABLISH HOW THE INCIDENT
OCCURRED, BUT ADMITTED THAT INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE HAD
BEEN CONFUSION BETWEEN ARMY AND PAC UNITS.

   THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID: "THE INFORMATION WE HAVE UP TO NOW IS
CONFUSING AS BOTH THE ARMY AND PAC HAD MOVED MEN BECAUSE THERE WERE
REPORTS THAT A REBEL UNIT WAS IN THE AREA."

   TEGUCIGALPA, 18 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] HONDURAN PRESIDENT JOSE
AZCONA HOYO TODAY SAID THAT THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR HAS REACHED
"ABOMINABLE AND HORRENDOUS" EXTREMES.

   THE PRESIDENT CITED THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS IN SAN
SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER AS PROOF OF "THE INCREDIBLE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE
REACHED IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY."

   AZCONA SAID THAT HE IS BEING KEPT INFORMED ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS
IN EL SALVADOR, EVEN SPEAKING WITH HIS COUNTERPART, ALFREDO CRISTIANI,
BUT DID NOT VOLUNTEER ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE MATTERS DISCUSSED.

   VARIOUS HONDURAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE EXPRESSED VIEWS SIMILAR TO THOSE VOICED BY THE PRESIDENT OF
HONDURAS, A COUNTRY THAT SHARES A 417-KM BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR.

   IN A STATEMENT RELEASED TODAY, THE HONDURAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE
"DEPLORED THE SAD INCIDENTS THAT RESULTED IN THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER
OF SIX JESUITS."  THE HONDURAN BISHOPS STRESSED THAT "THE FRATRICIDAL
STRUGGLE IS A BITTER RESULT OF THE INJUSTICE THAT THE SALVADORAN
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING."

   IN SIMILAR TERMS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC INNOVATION AND UNITY PARTY, AGREED THAT VIOLENCE IN EL
SALVADOR FINDS ITS ROOTS IN THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND ACTIONS IN
FAVOR OF THE OPPRESSED AND THE PEOPLE'S TRUE LIBERATION.

   THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE
SALVADORAN MILITARY SITUATION, AND THEY ALSO CONDEMNED THE FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).  RANKING OFFICERS, INCLUDING
NEW MILITARY COMMANDER COLONEL ARNULFO CANTARERO, MAINTAINED THAT EL
SALVADOR IS A VICTIM OF "COMMUNIST AGGRESSION."

   HOWEVER, THE MILITARY OFFICERS SAY THAT THEY WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE
THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT, WHICH INCREASED WHEN THE INSURGENTS BEGAN A
GENERAL OFFENSIVE A WEEK AGO.

   SAN SALVADOR, 14 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] MSGR GREGORIO ROSA
CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT PRESIDENT
ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MESSAGE REVEALING THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS
REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SIX JESUITS' SLAYING REPRESENTS "A DECISIVE
TURN TOWARD THE END OF IMPUNITY" IN THE COUNTRY.

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID IN HIS SUNDAY HOMILY THAT "THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO RECOVER THEIR TRUST IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S INSTITUTIONS."

   NEVERTHELESS, IN A STATEMENT GIVEN LATER TO THE MEDIA, THE
AUXILIARY BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE IMPLICATED MILITARY "DO NOT
REPRESENT ISOLATED CASES OF PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THE NORMS OF AN
INSTITUTION, BUT ARE ACTUALLY PART OF A FORMATION AND THOUGHT SCHEME
ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS SOMETHING
SUBVERSIVE."

   ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ, "THE MILITARY WORLD WRONGLY UNDERSTANDS
THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS."

   "ASKED ABOUT EVENTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES NOT SPECIFIED BY THE
PRESIDENT, ROSA CHAVEZ ANSWERED: "THIS GRAVE ACTION IS THE RESULT OF A
CONSPIRACY--AT LEAST A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE."

   HE EMPHASIZED THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STEP TAKEN YESTERDAY BY THE
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT "IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE LAST
ONE."

   THE BISHOP RECALLED THAT THIS YEAR IS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF MSGR
OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION, "WHICH HAS YET TO BE SOLVED,"
AND ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT "ALL THE LEGAL ACTIONS TO
INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHOSE
LIVES WERE TAKEN BY GUERRILLA GROUPS OR THE ARMY."

   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT THE CHURCH FULLY AGREES THAT THE CRIMES OF
THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SHOULD BE
INVESTIGATED "WITH THE SAME ZEAL" WITH WHICH THE JESUIT PRIESTS'
SLAYING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED.

   "HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE EXHAUSTIVELY AND
THOROUGHLY CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PROPAGANDISTIC APPEARANCE,"
HE ADDED.

   THE BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO IDEOLOGIES CONFRONTING EACH
OTHER IN EL SALVADOR EQUALLY DISDAIN HUMAN RIGHTS.

   "MARXISM IS THE ROOT OF THE FMLN'S ABUSE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY
DOCTRINE REPRESENTS THE BASIS OF THE ARMED FORCES' UNACCEPTABLE
REPRESSION," HE SAID.
