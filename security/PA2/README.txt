How to use
---

My program is written in Python and was tested on CADE machine lab1-18.
In on terminal run server.py and the program should now be listening for clients to connect.
In a second terminal run client.py. 
You should see TA, TB, and the shared secret key be printed out on both the client and server side.

Thanks!
