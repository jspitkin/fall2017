Part 2: Secret key encryption and decryption

My program is written in Python3 and was tested on CADE machine lab1-18.
I have generated sample output of my program for the messages 'kerplunk' and
'kerplunj'. This output can be found in kerplunk.trace and kerplunj.trace respectively.
I used the key 'wizardly' when testing.

How to use
---
The command to run program is "python3 secret_key.py <message> <key>".
For example to run my program with the word 'kerplunk' and key 'wizardly' you would
use 'python3 secret_key.py kerplunk wizardly'.

Running my program currently will write the output to 'test.trace'

Thank you.
